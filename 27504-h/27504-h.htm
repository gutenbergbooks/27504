<p>It is a still, hot day in autumn, and there is a droning
of mosquitoes where I sit by an open window, glancing
alternately out across the Assiniboian prairie and somewhat
blankly at the bundle of paper before me, ready to begin
this story. Its telling will not be an easy matter, but one
finds idle hours pass heavily after a life such as mine has
been, and since the bronco blundering into a badger-hole
fell and broke my leg the surgeon who rode forty miles to
set it said that if I was to work at harvest I must not move
before&mdash;and the harvest is already near. So I nibble the
pen and look around the long match-boarded hall, waiting
for the inspiration which is strangely slow in coming, while
my wife, who was Grace Carrington, smiles over her sewing
and suggests that it is high time to begin.</p>
<p>There are many guns on the wall glistening like sardines
with oil rubbed well in, and among them the old
Winchester which once saved us from starvation in British
Columbia. There are also long rows of painted butterflies
and moths whose colors pleased Grace&#8217;s fancy when I
caught them in the sloos. Sometimes I wonder whether she
really likes that kind of decoration, or merely pinned them
to the wall because I caught them for her. Then, and this
is my own fancy, the bit of the horse which once saved her
life hangs in a place of its own under the heads of the
antelopes and the forward half of a crane with which a
Winnipeg taxidermist has travestied nature. There are
also a few oil paintings and, of course, some furniture, but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
am not learned in such matters, and know only that it cost
me many dollars when I brought it from Toronto on one
of Grace&#8217;s birthdays, and I have never regretted the investment.</p>
<p>No, there is nothing here that merits much comment,
though Fairmead is one of the finest homesteads between
the Saskatchewan and the Souris. Then as I gaze with
half-closed eyes through the open window the memories
awaken and crowd, as it were, upon one another. Far out
on the rim of the prairie lies a silvery haze, through which
the vault of azure melts into the dusty whiteness of the
grasses. Then, level on level, with each slowly swelling
rise growing sharper under that crystalline atmosphere the
prairie rolls in, broken here by a willow copse and there by
a straggling birch bluff, while a belt of cool neutral shadow
marks the course of a deep-sunk ravine. At first sight it
is all one glaring sweep of white and gray, but on looking
closer with understanding eyes one sees the yellow and
sage-green of tall reeds in a sloo, the glowing lights of sun-bleached
buffalo bones, and a mingling of many colors
where there is wild peppermint or flowers among the grass.
Then, broad across the foreground, growing tall and green
in a few moister places, and in others changing to ochre
and coppery red, there ripples, acre after acre, a great sea
of grain whose extent is beyond the comprehension of the insular
Briton.</p>
<p>That, at least, with its feathery oat tassels and stately
heads of wheat, is a picture well worth looking upon, for
there are few places in the world where one may see
furrows of equal length. It was won hardly, by much
privation, and in the sweat of the brow, as well as by the
favor of Providence, as Grace would say, and she is right
in most things, except when she attempts to instruct me
in stock feeding, for we hold on the prairie that it is not fair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
to place all the burden on Providence. Therefore the
settlers who succeed cut down rations and work double tides
to help themselves in time of adversity.</p>
<p>Yes, though better men have done more and failed, we
worked hard enough for it, Harry Lorraine and I, stinting
ourselves often to feed the stock and deal justly with the
soil, until at last the ill-fortune turned and the kindly earth
repaid us a hundred fold for our trust in it.</p>
<p>Grace partly approves of the foregoing, for she laid by
her sewing to read the loose sheets beside me, bending down
until her hair, which is bronze-gold with the sun in it, just
touched my own. It may be that my eyes are prejudiced,
but I have never seen a woman who might compare
with her. Neither has her comeliness faded. Instead, it has
grown even more refined and stately, for Grace had always
a queenly way, since the day when I first met her, the fairest
maid&mdash;I think so now, though it is long ago&mdash;that ever
trod the bleak moorlands of eastern Lancashire.</p>
<p>Beyond the wheat and straggling birches I can see the
shingled roofs of Harry&#8217;s dwelling. We have long been
partners&mdash;all the Winnipeg dealers know the firm of
Lorimer &amp; Lorraine, and how they send their wheat in by
special freight train. Then there is a stretch of raw breaking,
and the tinkle of the binders rises out of a hidden hollow,
as tireless arms of wood and steel pile up the sheaves of
Jasper&#8217;s crop&mdash;Jasper takes a special pride in forestalling
us. The dun smoke of a smudge-fire shows that Harry is
in prairie fashion protecting our stock, and I see it drifting
eastward across the dusty plain, with the cattle seeking shelter
from the mosquitoes under it.</p>
<p>The management of a farm like Fairmead is a serious
task, even when there are two to do it, and Grace says there
are weighty responsibilities attached. How many toilers in
crowded Europe benefit by the cheap flour we send them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
I do not know, though last year we kept the Winnipeg
millers busy; but when, in conjunction with a certain
society, we opened new lands and homes for the homeless
poor&mdash;it was Grace&#8217;s pet project&mdash;all those who occupied
them were not thankful. Some also stole their neighbors&#8217;
chickens, and the said neighbors abused us. Others seemed
more inclined to live on one another than to wrest a living
from the soil, while once Macdonald of the Northwest Police
lodged a solemn protest, &#8220;We&#8217;ll hold ye baith responsible
for the depredations o&#8217; the wastrels who&#8217;re disturbing
the harmony o&#8217; this peaceful prairie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Harry and I were once poor enough ourselves,
and with Grace&#8217;s help we have done our best to weed out
the worthless&mdash;Harry attends to this&mdash;and encourage the
rest. Very many bushels of seed-wheat has Grace given
them, and here as elsewhere there are considerably more good
than bad, while already a certain society takes to itself the
credit of the flourishing Fairmead colony. Harry, however,
says that undeserved prosperity has made me an optimist.
But the reader will wonder how I, Ralph Lorimer, who
landed in Canada with one hundred pounds&#8217; capital, became
owner of Fairmead and married Grace, only daughter and
heiress of Colonel Carrington. Well, that is a long story,
and looking back at the beginning of it instead of at the
sunlit prairie I see a grimy smoke-blackened land where
gaunt chimneys stand in rows, and behind it the bare moors
of Lancashire. Then again the memories change like the
glasses of a kaleidoscope, and I sigh as I remember comrades
who helped us in our necessity and who now, forgotten
by all save a few, sleep among the snow-bound ranges,
under the bitter alkali dust, and deep in the smoking ca√±ons
through which we carried the new steel highway.</p>
<p>Failures, probably their friends called them at home, but
in this their friends were wrong. With light jest, or grim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
silent endurance, they played out the lost game to the
bitter end, and laid the foundations of a great country&#8217;s
prosperity, while if fate or fortune has favors for but the
few, those who receive them should remember with becoming
humility what otherwise they might have been. So the
past comes back, struggle, disappointment, and slow success,
at last, until it is a relief when Harry Lorraine strides
laughing in and Grace fills for him a great polished horn
of cider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s success to your story! Tell them simply how
we live and work, and some of us, the best, have died in
this land,&#8221; he says. Then he raises the horn high toward
the rafters and I know his meaning. It is a way the forerunners
of civilization&mdash;axe-man, paddle-man, and railroad
shoveler&mdash;had, and he did it in memory of one who lies
far off among the northern snows. Taking up the weary
pen as he and Grace go out together I prepare to follow
his counsel, telling the story simply and as it happened from
the beginning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST SOWING</h3>
</div>

<p>It was late in autumn, and the heather had faded into
dingy brown, though long streaks of golden fern crept
winding down, when Grace Carrington first talked with
me of the Canadian Dominion on the bleak slopes of Starcross
Moor. There was a hollow in the hillside where a
few pale-stemmed birches and somber firs formed, as it
were, a rampart between the poor, climbing meadows and
the waste of gorse and fern, and we two beneath them
seemed utterly alone in the moorland solitude.</p>
<p>Grace sat on a lichened boulder with the sunlight upon
her, gazing down across the levels of Lancashire. I was
just twenty years old, and she seemed the incarnation of all
that was fresh and good in early womanhood. Still, it was
not only her beauty that attracted me, though she was the
well-dowered daughter of a race which has long been famous
for fair women, but a certain grave dignity that made
her softly spoken wishes seem commands that it would be
a pleasure to obey. Grace was nineteen then, and she
lived in Western Canada with her widowed father, Colonel
Carrington, who had made himself a power in that country.
Yet she was English by birth and early training, of the

fair-haired, gray-eyed, old Lancashire stock, and had lost
nothing by her sojourn on the prairie as youthful mistress of
Carrington Manor.</p>
<p>The land which ran west before us was not a pleasant
one. Across its horizon hung a pall of factory smoke; and
unlovely hamlets, each with its gaunt pit-head gear and
stark brick chimney, sprinkled the bare fields between, for
hedgerows were scanty and fences of rusty colliery rope
replaced them. Yet it was a wealthy country, and bred
keen-witted, enterprising men, who, uncouth often in speech
and exterior, possessed an energy that has spread their
commerce to the far corners of the earth. That day the
autumn haze wrapped a mellow dimness round its defects,
but Grace Carrington sighed as she turned toward me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not be sorry to go home again,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Perhaps I miss our clear sunshine, but here everyone looks
careworn in your dingy towns, and there are so many poor.
Besides, the monotony of those endless smoky streets oppresses
me. No, I should not care to come back to Lancashire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the words of a young and winsome woman seldom
fall lightly on the ears of a young man, and Grace spoke
without affectation as one accustomed to be listened to, which
was hardly surprising in the heiress of Carrington. As it
happened, they wakened an answering echo within me.
The love of the open sky had been handed down to me
through long generations of a yeoman ancestry, and yet
fate had apparently decreed that I should earn my bread in
the counting-house of a cotton-mill. It is probable that
I should have been abashed and awkward before this patrician
damsel in a drawing-room, but here, under the blue
lift, with the brown double-barrel&mdash;it was my uncle&#8217;s new
hammerless&mdash;across my knees, and the speckled birds beneath,
I felt in harmony with the surroundings, and accordingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
at ease. I was born and bred under the other edge
of the moor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not always rain here, though this has been a
wet season, and trade is bad,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Will you tell me
about Canada, Miss Carrington?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes brightened as she answered: &#8220;It is my adopted
country, and I love it. Still it is no place for the weak and
idle, for as they say out there, we have no room for any
but live men and strong. Yet, I never saw a ragged
woman nor heard of a hungry child. All summer the settlers
work from dawn to dusk under the clear sunshine of
the open prairie, paying rent to no one, for each tills his own
land, and though there are drawbacks&mdash;drought, hail, and
harvest-frost&mdash;they meet them lightly, for you see neither
anxious faces nor bent shoulders there. Our people walk
upright, as becomes free men. Then, through the long
winter, when the snow lies firm and white, and the wheat
crop has been hauled in, you can hear the jingling sleigh
teams flit across the prairie from homestead to homestead
under the cloudless blue. The settlers enjoy themselves when
their work is done&mdash;and we have no drunkenness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ceased, turning an eager face toward me, and I felt
an old longing increase. It was the inborn love of a fertile
soil&mdash;and that wide sunlit country seemed to call me, for
my father had been the last of a long family to hold one of
the extensive farms which with their crumbling feudal halls
may yet be found in the remoter corners of Lancashire.
Then, asking practical questions, I wondered as Grace
Carrington answered, because, though she wore the stamp
of refinement to her finger-tips, she knew all that concerned
the feeding of stock, and the number of bushels that might
be thrashed from an acre of wheat. I knew she spoke as
one having experience, for I had been taught to till the
soil, and only entered the cotton-mill when on my father&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
death it was found that his weakness for horses and his unlucky
experiments had rendered it impossible that I should
carry on the farm. So, while unobserved the sun sank low,
I listened eagerly; until at last there was a sound of footsteps
among the fern, and she ceased, after a glance at her
watch. But, like the grain she spoke of, drilled into the
black Assiniboian loam, the seed had been sown, and in due
time the crop would ripen to maturity.</p>
<p>A man came out from the birches, a handsome man,
glancing about him with a look of indolent good humor on
his face, and though for a moment Grace Carrington
seemed displeased, she showed no sign of it as she rose
leisurely to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry you had to come in search of me, Geoffrey,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;this is Mr. Lorimer&mdash;Captain Ormond. I
think you have met before. I lost my way, and he kindly
brought me across the moor. I have been telling him about
Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newcomer bowed with an easy indifference, for
which, not knowing exactly why, I disliked him, as he said,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t remember that pleasure&mdash;meet so many people!
Canada must be a very nice place; been thinking of going
out there myself&mdash;drive oxen, grow potatoes, and that kind
of thing, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at Grace, as though seeking her approval
of such an act of self-sacrifice; but the girl laughed frankly
as she answered, &#8220;I can&#8217;t fancy you tramping behind the
plow in a jacket patched with flour-bags, Geoffrey;&#8221; while,
feeling myself overlooked, and not knowing what to say,
I raised my cap and awkwardly turned away. Still, looking
back, I caught the waft of a light dress among the fern,
and frowned as the sound of laughter came down the wind.
These people had been making merry, I thought, at my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
expense, though I had fancied Miss Carrington incapable
of such ungenerous conduct.</p>
<p>In this, however, I misjudged her, for long afterward I
learned that Grace was laughing at the stories her companion
told of his strange experiences with sundry recruits, until
presently the latter said:</p>
<p>&#8220;She stoops to conquer, even a raw Lancashire lad. I
congratulate you on your judgment, Gracie. There is something
in that untrained cub&mdash;could recognize it by the
steady, disapproving way he looked at me; but I am some
kind of a relative, which is presumably a warrant for impertinence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now a saving sense of humor tempered Miss Carrington&#8217;s
seriousness, and Geoffrey Ormond joined in her merry
laugh. In spite of his love of ease and frivolous badinage,
he was, as I was to learn some day, considerably less of a
good-natured fool than it occasionally pleased him to appear
to be.</p>
<p>Meantime, I strode homeward with the fierce longing
growing stronger. I hated the dingy office where I sat
under a gas-jet making up the count of yarn; and yet four
weary years I had labored there, partly because I had to earn
my bread and because my uncle and sole guardian greatly
desired I should. It grew dark as I entered the valley
which led to his house, for the cotton-spinner now lived
ten miles by rail from his mill, and the sighing of the pine
branches under a cold breeze served to increase my restlessness.
So it was with a sense of relief that I found my cousin
Alice waiting in a cosy corner of the fire-lit drawing-room.
We had known each other from childhood, and, though for
that very reason this is not always the case, we were the best
of friends. She would be rich some day, so the men I met
in her father&#8217;s business said; but if Alice Lorimer ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
remembered the fact, it made but little difference to her.
She was delicate, slight, and homely, with a fund of shrewd
common-sense and a very kindly heart, whose thoughts, however,
she did not always reveal. Now she sat on a lounge
before the fire, with the soft light of a colored lamp falling
upon her, while a great embroidered screen shut off the rest
of the partly-darkened room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been waiting for you with the tea so patiently,
Ralph,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You look tired and moody&mdash;you have
been out on the moors too long. See, here is a low chair
ready just inside the screen, and here is the tea. Sit down
and tell me what is troubling you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I settled myself in the corner, and answered, looking
into the fire:</p>
<p>&#8220;You were always kind to me, Alice, and one can talk to
you. Something made me unsettled to-day, and I didn&#8217;t
care about the birds, though I got a plump brace for you.
Alice, I can&#8217;t help thinking that these brief holidays, though
they are like a glimpse of Paradise after my dingy rooms
in that sickening town, are not good for me. I am only a
poor clerk in your father&#8217;s mill, and such things as guns
and horses are out of my sphere. They only stir up useless
longings. So I return on Monday, and hardly think that I
shall come back for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice laughed softly, for she was a shrewd young person,
then she laid her little hand restrainingly on my arm, before
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;And who has a better right to the bay horse and the new
hammerless ejector than the nephew of the man who never
uses them? Now, I&#8217;m guessing at a secret, but it&#8217;s probable
that your uncle bought that gun especially for you. Ralph,
you are getting morbid&mdash;and you have not been shooting
all day. Did you meet Miss Carrington on the moor
again?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>Now in such matters I was generally a blunderer; yet
something warned me that my answer would displease her.
I could, however, see no way of avoiding it, and when I
said as unconcernedly as I could, &#8220;Yes, and talked to her
about Canada!&#8221; Alice for no particular reason stooped and
dropped a thread into the fire. Then lifting her head she
looked at me steadily when I continued, with some hesitation:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how I was always taught that in due time
I should work the lands of Lindale Hall, and how, when
we found on my father&#8217;s death that there was nothing left,
I tried the cotton-mill. Well, after four years&#8217; trial I like
it worse than I did at the beginning, and now I feel that I
must give it up. I am going back to the soil again, even if
it is across the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice made no answer for a few moments; then she
said slowly: &#8220;Ralph you will not be rash; think it over
well. Now tell me if you have any definite plans&mdash;you
know how I always used to advise you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt I needed sympathy, and Alice was a faithful confidant,
so I opened my heart to her, and she listened with
patient interest. It seemed to me that my cousin had
never looked so winsome as she sat close beside me with a
slight flush of color in her usually pale face where the
soft lamplight touched it. So we sat and talked until
Martin Lorimer entered unobserved, and when, on hearing
a footstep, I looked up I saw that he was smiling with what
seemed grim approval as his eyes rested on us, and this
puzzled me. Then his daughter started almost guiltily as
he said, &#8220;I wondered where you two were. Dinner has
been waiting, and you never heard the bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>I retired early that night, and, being young, forgot my
perplexities in heavy slumber. The next morning I noticed
that Alice&#8217;s eyes seemed heavy, and I wondered what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
could be the reason. In after years I mentioned it when
Grace and I were talking about old times together, but she
only smiled gravely, and said, &#8220;I sometimes think your
cousin was too good for this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day was one of those wet Sundays which it is
hard to forget. The bleak moor was lost in vapor, and a
pitiless drizzle came slanting down the valley, while the raw
air seemed filled with falling leaves. A prosperous man
with a good conscience may make light of such things, but
they leave their own impression on the poor and anxious; so,
divided between two courses, I wandered up and down, finding
rest nowhere until I chanced upon a large new atlas in
my uncle&#8217;s library. Martin Lorimer was proud of his
library. He was a well-read man, though like others of his
kind he made no pretense at scholarship, and used the broad,
burring dialect when he spoke in his mill. Here I found
occupation studying the Dominion of Canada, especially the
prairie territories, and lost myself in dreams of half-mile
furrows and a day&#8217;s ride straight as the crow flies across
a cattle run, all of which, though I scarcely dared hope it
then, came true in its own appointed time.</p>
<p>My uncle had ridden out early, for he was to take part
in the new mayor&#8217;s state visit to church in the manufacturing
town, and even Alice seemed out of spirits, so
when I left the library there was the weary afternoon to be
dragged through somehow. It passed very slowly, and then
as I stood by the stables a man from the house at the further
end of the valley, where Colonel Carrington was staying,
said to our stable lad:</p>
<p>&#8220;I mun hurry back. Our folks are wantin&#8217; t&#8217; horses;
maister an&#8217; t&#8217; Colonel&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s going to the church
parade. They&#8217;re sayin&#8217; it&#8217;s a grand turnout, wi&#8217; t&#8217; firemen,
bands, an&#8217; t&#8217; volunteers, in big brass helmets!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>Neither of them saw me, and presently calling the lad
I bade him put the bay horse into the dog-cart.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in a gradely bad temper,&#8221; said the lad doubtfully.
&#8220;Not done nothink but eat for a long time now, an&#8217; he
nearly bit a piece out of me; I wish t&#8217; maister would shoot
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>I laughed at the warning, though I had occasion to
remember it, and looking for Alice I said, &#8220;I am driving
in to church to-night. Would you like to come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Alice Lorimer possessed her father&#8217;s keen perception,
and when he kept his temper he was perhaps the
shrewdest man I ever met; so when she looked me straight
in the face I dropped my eyes, because I really was not
anxious for her company, and should not have gone except
in the hope of seeing Grace Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you turned religious suddenly, Ralph?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Or have you forgotten you told me yesterday that you
did not care to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>I made some awkward answer, but Alice smiled dryly,
and with a solemn courtesy said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Two are company, three are none. Cousin Ralph, I
will not go with you. But don&#8217;t leave the dog-cart behind
and come back with the shafts.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went out with a flushed face, and a sense of relief,
angry, nevertheless, that she should read my inmost thoughts,
having fancied that my invitation was a stroke of diplomacy.
I learned afterward that diplomacy is a mistake for
the simple man. With a straightforward &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;
he can often turn aside the schemes of the cunning, but on
forsaking these he generally finds the other side considerably
too clever for him&mdash;all of which is a wanton digression
from the story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE CHURCH PARADE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was raining hard when I climbed into the dog-cart and
rattled away into the darkness, while somewhat to my
surprise Robert the Devil, or Devilish Bob, as those who
had the care of him called the bay horse, played no antics
on the outward journey, which was safely accomplished.
So leaving him at the venerable &#8220;Swan,&#8221; I hurried through
the miry streets toward the church. They were thronged
with pale-faced men and women who had sweated out their
vigor in the glare of red furnace, dye-shop, and humming
mill, but there was no lack of enthusiasm. I do not think
there are any cities in the world with the same public spirit
and pride in local customs that one may find in the grimy
towns of Lancashire. The enthusiasm is, however, part of
their inhabitants&#8217; nature, and has nothing to do with the
dismal surroundings.</p>
<p>A haze of smoke had mingled with the rain; yellow
gas jets blinked through it, though it would not be dark for
an hour or so yet; and the grim, smoke-blackened houses
seemed trickling with water. Still every one laughed and
chattered with good-humored expectancy, even the many
who had no umbrellas. It was hard work to reach the
church, though I opined that all the multitude did not
intend to venture within, and when once I saw my uncle
with a wand in his hand I carefully avoided him. Martin
Lorimer was a power and well liked in that town, but I
had not driven ten miles to assist him. Then I waited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
among the jostling crowd in a fever of impatience, wondering
whether Miss Carrington had yet gone in, until at last I
saw the Colonel marching through the throng, which&mdash;and
knowing the temperament of our people I wondered at it&mdash;made
way for him. There were others of the party behind,
and my heart leaped at the sight of Grace. She was walking
beside Captain Ormond, who smiled down at her.</p>
<p>Then, just as the Colonel passed within, a burst of cheering
broke out, and in the mad scramble for the entrance
Grace, who turned a moment to recover the cloak she
dropped, was separated from her companion. He was driven
forward in the thickest part of the stream of excited human
beings, and fortune had signally favored me. Squeezing
through from behind a pillar I reached her side, and
grew hot with pride when she slipped her arm through mine,
and we were borne forward irresistibly by the surging
crowd. Once I saw Ormond vainly trying to make his
way back in search of his companion, and I stood so that
he could not see her. Half-way down the aisle we met an
official who recognized me as a nephew of Martin Lorimer.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll find you and the lady seats in the chancel. It will be
the only good place left,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I did not care where we went, as long as Grace went
with me, and when he ensconced us under an oaken canopy
among the ancient carved stalls I longed that the service
might last a century, while Grace&#8217;s quiet &#8220;Thank you, I
am so interested,&#8221; filled me with ecstasy.</p>
<p>The church was interesting. There are many cathedrals
that could not compare with it; and it was very old.
The damp haze had entered the building, and obscuring
half the clearstory it enhanced its stateliness, for the great
carved pillars and arches led the wandering eye aloft and
lost it in a mystery, while far up at the western end above
the organ a gilded Gloria caught a stray shaft of light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
and blazed out of the gloom. I saw Grace&#8217;s eyes rest on it,
and then I followed them down across the sea of faces, along
the quaint escutcheons, and over two marble tombs, until
she fixed them on her father, who with his party sat in a
high-backed pew. The crash of music outside ceased, and
with a steady tramp of feet, file by file, men in scarlet uniform
moved up the aisle; while before them, led by the
sword and gilded mace, came a little homely man, who
seemed burdened by his glittering chain, and most uncomfortable.
As I knew, he commenced his business career
with ten pounds&#8217; capital, and could hardly speak plain
English, while now his goods were known in every bazaar
from Cairo to Singapore. This knowledge fostered a vague
but daring hope within me.</p>
<p>I remember little of the service beyond Grace&#8217;s voice
ringing high and clear in the &#8220;Magnificat,&#8221; while for perhaps
the first time I caught a glimmer of its full significance,
and her face, clean-cut against the shadow where a fretted
pinnacle allowed one shaft of light to pass it, looking, I
thought, like that of a haloed saint. The rest was all a
blurred impression of rolling music, half-seen faces, and gay
uniforms, until a tall old man of commanding personality
stood high aloft in the carved pulpit, and proclaimed a doctrine
that seemed strangely out of place in the busy town.
Honest labor brought its own reward in the joy of diligent
toil, he said, and the prize of fame or money was a much
slighter thing. I could not quite understand this then, for
there were many in that district whose daily toil wore body
and soul away, so that none of them might hope to live out
half of man&#8217;s allotted span, while a prize for which I would
have given my life sat close beside me, and twice that evening
the calm proud eyes had smiled gratefully into mine.</p>
<p>Still, there was one drawback. As chance would have
it, Minnie Lee, who operated the typewriter in the mill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
offices, sat just opposite, and would cast mischievous glances
toward me. We were good friends in a way, for during
two years I had talked to her on business matters every
day, and sometimes also indulged in innocent badinage.
She was fair-haired and delicately pretty, and was said to be
aware of it; but now of all times I did not want those
playful smiles directed toward me. However, I hoped that
Grace did not see them; and not knowing what else to do,
for I could not frown at her, I sought refuge in what proved
to be a bewildering chapter of genealogy, until the building
trembled as the vast assembly joined in the closing hymn.
Long afterward, out on the lone prairie when the stars
shone down through the bitter frost, I could hear in fancy
Grace&#8217;s voice rising beside me through the great waves of
sound. Then I would remember the song of the speckled
thrush singing at sunset after a showery April day through
the shadow of a copse.</p>
<p>We reached the street safely, though in that press there
was no hope of finding Colonel Carrington, even if I wished
it, which I certainly did not, so after some demur and the
discussing of other expedients, Grace accepted my offer to
drive her home. &#8220;I am afraid it can&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; she said,
I thought with quite unnecessary cruelty.</p>
<p>The dog-cart was ready, and Robert the Devil went
well. The long streets rolled behind us, and were lost in
the rain; then with a rhythmic drumming of hoofs and
a constant splashing from under the whirring wheels, we
swept out into the blackness of a treeless plain. I knew
the road and did not take the shortest one; and it was
rapture to draw the rugs and apron round Grace&#8217;s waist,
and feel the soft furs she wore brushing against me. The
ten miles passed in what seemed to be scarcely as many minutes,
and the rush through the damp air&mdash;for the rain had
ceased at last&mdash;raised my companion&#8217;s spirits, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
chatted merrily; then, just as we reached the crest of a steep
dip into the Starcross valley, the Devil must take fright at
a colored railway light that he had often seen before.</p>
<p>I knew we were in for a struggle, and got both hands
on the reins; but two men would hardly have held him.
The next moment, with a mad rattle of wheels and red
sparks flashing under the battering hoofs, we went flying into
the long dark hollow, while I think I prayed that the Devil
might keep his footing on the loose stones of a very bad
road. One lurch flung Grace against the guard-rail, the
next against my shoulder, and I remember feeling when
the little hand fastened on my arm, that I would gladly
have done battle with ten wild horses were she also not in
jeopardy. Fresh drizzle lashed our faces, the wind screamed
past, the wheels seemed to leave the ground alternately, and
a light rushed up toward us from below, while with my
teeth hard set I wondered what would happen when we
reached the sharp bend at the bottom.</p>
<p>I got the Devil around it somehow, and then breathed
easier, for the steep slope of Starcross Brow rose close ahead,
and I knew no horse was ever foaled which could run away
up that. So, trusting to one hand, I slipped my arm round
Grace&#8217;s waist, and, thrilled at the touch of her damp hair
on my neck, &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold you safe; we are near the end, and
the danger will soon be past,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>It turned out so, for though Robert the Devil charged
the hill gallantly, Starcross Brow proved too much for him,
and, with a sigh of relief, Grace drew herself away. &#8220;I
must thank you, Mr. Lorimer. You drive well,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then I thought that if she had been like Minnie, or
even cousin Alice, I might have ventured to replace the
protecting arm, but there was something about Grace Carrington
that made one treat her, as it were, with reverence.
When we drew up in front of Starcross House a carriage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
with flashing lamps stood in the drive; I had seen those
lights coming down the opposite side of the valley. After
Grace had thanked me with a quiet friendliness as I helped
her down, a group turned to meet us at the door. The first
was a tall, thin-faced man of commanding presence with a
long gray moustache, and he stared hard at me with a
haughtiness that I fancied was tinctured with contempt,
while Captain Ormond stood behind him, smiling languidly
and lifted a warning finger unobserved to Grace. There
was something forbidding about Colonel Carrington, and to
the last few men liked him. I remember Harry Lorraine
once comparing him to Coriolanus&mdash;&#8220;Steeped in pride to
the backbone,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but it&#8217;s a clean pride, and
there&#8217;s a good deal of backbone about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you safe, Grace,&#8221; he commenced.
&#8220;We were rather anxious about you. But where have you
been, and how did we pass you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I never saw Grace either confused or taken by surprise,
and when she explained quietly her father looked down at
me from the top step as he said, &#8220;I thank you, sir, but I did
not catch the name. May I ask who it is to whom we are
so much indebted? Neither do I quite understand yet how
we got here before you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing in the words, but the glance and
tone conveyed the idea that he regretted the debt, while
the whimsical look on Ormond&#8217;s face aided in stirring me,
for we had democratic notions in that part of Lancashire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph Lorimer, assistant cashier in the Orb Mill,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;It was a slight service, and I did not consider the
shortest way best;&#8221; while before the Colonel could answer
I raised my hat to Grace, and, taking Robert the Devil&#8217;s
head, turned him sharply around. Still, as I climbed into
the dog-cart I saw that the burly master of Starcross House
was chuckling at something, and I drove away feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
strangely satisfied with myself, until I began to wonder
whether after all to walk twice off the field defiantly before
the enemy was not another form of cowardice. Alice met
me on the threshold&mdash;for she heard the wheels&mdash;with a
query as to why the Satanic Robert was in such a state; but
for several reasons I did not fully enlighten her.</p>
<p>My uncle did not return that night, and I left for town
the next morning. In the afternoon I sought an interview
with him in his private office. It was with some trepidation
that I entered, because Martin Lorimer was frank of speech
and quick in temper, and I knew he was then busy with
the details of a scheme that might double the output of his
mill. He thrust the papers away and leaned forward on
his desk, a characteristic specimen of his race, square in jaw
and shoulder, with keenness and power stamped on his
wrinkled face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ralph, what is it now?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Johnson of
Starcross has been telling me some tale about your running
away with an heiress and giving his answer to Colonel
Carrington. I&#8217;m not altogether sorry. I do not like that
man. There is also a reason why he doesn&#8217;t like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with that, sir,&#8221; I answered awkwardly.
&#8220;You know I have never asked questions about
the family money; and you have been very kind to me. But
the fact is I can&#8217;t stand the mill, and I&#8217;m thinking of asking
for whatever remains of my share and going out to Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Lorimer smote the desk suddenly with his fist,
and there was angry bewilderment in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hast gone mad altogether, lad?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>I met his gaze steadily. &#8220;No,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
help longing for a life in the open air; and there is room in
Canada for poor people like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, thrusting his square jaw forward, he said: &#8220;Thy
father left four hundred pounds in all. It is now five, under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
my stewardship. Shall I ask the cashier to make out a statement?
Thy father had whims and fancies, or it would
have been four thousand. Tom Lorimer could never see
which side of his bread was buttered. He was born a fool,
like thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flinging back my head I rose facing him. But he
thundered, &#8220;Stop! You ought to know my meaning. He
was an open-handed gentleman, and my well-loved brother.
If you take your share of the five hundred, what is going to
educate your brother Reggie and your sister Aline? I presume
you know the fees they charge at both those schools?
And did you ever ask whether I had plans for thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was silent a moment. For the first time it struck me
with sudden shame that Martin Lorimer had already most
generously done his best to start his brother&#8217;s orphans well
in life. Then I answered slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon. I recognize your goodness; but I
know I should never be successful in the mill. I&#8217;m sorry,
but that is only the simple truth. Let Reggie and Aline
keep all, except enough for a third-class passage to Winnipeg.
This is not a rash whim. It has taken me three years to
make up my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s an end of the matter,&#8221; said Martin Lorimer.
&#8220;Stubbornness is in the family, and you are your
father&#8217;s son. An archangel would hardly have moved poor
Tom! Well, lad, you shall not go penniless, nor third-class,
if it&#8217;s only for the credit of the name; and you can&#8217;t go until
spring. I thank thee for telling me; but I&#8217;m busy, and
we&#8217;ll talk again. Hast told thy cousin Alice about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes had lost their angry flash before I went out, and
something in his change of tone revealed the hard bargain-maker&#8217;s
inner self.</p>
<p>Minnie Lee smiled over the typewriter as I passed her
room, and I went in to tell her about it. I felt I must talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
to some one; and, if not gifted with much sense, she was a
sympathetic girl. She listened with a pretty air of dismay,
and said petulantly, &#8220;So I shall lose my only friend in this
dreary mill! Don&#8217;t they pay high wages for my work in
Montreal and Winnipeg? Well, if you hear of a situation
you can send straight back for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a door slammed, and I saw a frown on my uncle&#8217;s
face as, perhaps attracted by the sound of voices, he glanced
into the room on passing. Still, it was some time afterward
before I learned that he had heard the last words; and, remembering
them eventually when recalled by events, Minnie&#8217;s
careless speech proved an unfortunate one for both of us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE LAND OF PROMISE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a dismal afternoon in early spring when I lounged
disconsolately about the streets of Winnipeg. The
prairie metropolis had not then attained its present magnitude,
but it was busy and muddy enough; for when the
thaw comes the mire of a Western town is indescribable.
Also odd showers of wet snow came down, and I shivered
under my new skin coat, envying the busy citizens who,
with fur caps drawn low down, hurried to and fro. One
and all wore the stamp of prosperity, and their voices had
a cheerful ring that grated on me, for I of all that bustling
crowd seemed idle and without a purpose. So, feeling
utterly forlorn, a stranger in a very strange and, at first
sight, a forbidding land, I trudged up and down, waiting
for the evening train which was to bear me west, and
pondering over all that had happened during the past few
weeks.</p>
<p>There was the parting with my uncle, who laid a strong
hand on my shoulder and lapsed into the speech of the
country as he said, &#8220;I need not tell thee to set thy teeth and
hang on through the first few years, lad. Thy father played
out a losing game only too staunchly; and it&#8217;s stey work
at the beginning. I mind when I started the mill&mdash;but
that&#8217;s an old story. It&#8217;s the man who can grin and bear
it, coming up smiling after each fall, who wins in the end.
And thou hast all the world before thee. Still, remember
there are staunch friends behind thee here in Lancashire.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>I think his fingers shook a little, but Martin Lorimer
was not addicted to much display of sentiment, and with a
cough he hurried away; though I remember that the old
cashier, who had served him since he started, putting a
sealed envelope in my hand, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a draft for one hundred pounds on the Bank of
Montreal, and it&#8217;s a secret; but I&#8217;m not debiting the estate
with it. Thou&#8217;rt a gradely fool for thy trouble, Ralph Lorimer.
But I knew thy father, and, like him, thou mun go
thy own way. Well, maybe it&#8217;s for the best; and good luck
go with thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next came my farewell from cousin Alice, who blushed
as, laying before me a fine Winchester repeating rifle, which
must have cost her some trouble to obtain in England then,
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a little keepsake, but I thought you would
like it&mdash;and you will remember your cousin when you use
it. Ralph, you have chosen to work out your own destiny,
and for many a night your uncle fumed over it until at last
he said that the child who fought for scraps in the gutter
grew to be worth any two of the spoon-fed. You know how
fond he is of forcible simile, and he frowned when I suggested
that Canada was not a gutter. Still, it is too late to
consider whether you did well, and I ask, as a last favor,
if you are ever unfortunate, if only for the sake of old times,
you will let us know. And now I wish you all prosperity.
Good-bye, Ralph dear, and God bless you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were dim, and she looked so small and fragile
that I stooped and kissed her, while though she drew herself
suddenly away with the crimson mantling upward from her
neck, I felt that whatever happened I had a friend for life in
Alice Lorimer.</p>
<p>Now all of that had faded into the past that I had left
behind across the sea, and henceforward I knew there must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
be no more glancing back. I had chosen my own path,
and must press forward with eyes turned steadfastly ahead,
although at present I could see no further than the prairie
station that I would reach some time before dawn the next
day. A wheat-grower&#8217;s dwelling thirty miles back from the
railroad was registered as wanting assistance, the immigration
officer said. Slowly, with more snow and a freshening of
the bitter wind, the afternoon wore itself away, and I was
glad when that evening I boarded the west-bound train. It
was thronged with emigrants of many nationalities, and
among them were Scandinavian maidens, tow-haired and
red-cheeked, each going out to the West to be married.
Their courtship would be brief and unromantic, but, as I
was afterward to learn, three-fourths of the marriages
so made turned out an unqualified success. Still, I found a
corner in the smoking end of a long Colonist car, and, with
the big bell clanging and a storm of voices exchanging farewells
in many tongues, the great locomotive hauled us out
into the whirling snow.</p>
<p>Thick flakes beat on the windows, and icy draughts swept
through the car, while the big stove in a boxed-in corner
hummed with a drowsy roar. With half-closed eyes I
leaned back against the hard maple while the preceding
scenes of the long journey rolled like a panorama before me.
Twelve days it took the ancient steamer, which swarmed
like a hive, to thrash through mist and screaming gale across
the Atlantic, while fifteen hundred emigrants below wished
themselves dead. Then there followed an apparently endless
transit in the lurching cars, where we slept as best we
could on uncushioned seats and floor, through dark pine forests,
with only an occasional tin-roofed hamlet to break the
monotony. After that there were wooden cities in Ontario
very much like the hamlets of a larger growth; and when at
last sickened by the vibration, we sped out on to the long-expected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
prairie, the prospect was by no means inviting.
Spring, I was told, was very late that year, and the plains
rolled before us to the horizon a dreary white wilderness
streaked by willow-swale, with at first many lonely lakes
rippling a bitter steely-blue under the blasts, while crackling
ice fringed their shores. Then several of my companions,
who were young and romantic Britons with big revolvers
strapped about them under their jackets, grew suspiciously
quiet, and said no more about the strange adventures they
had looked for in the West. There was nothing romantic
about this land, which lacked even the clear skies Grace
Carrington spoke of. It looked a hard country, out of which
only a man with the power of stubborn endurance could
wrest a living.</p>
<p>So with a rhythmic beat of whirring wheels, and now and
again a clash of couplings as we slid down some hollow
of the track, we rolled on through the night, while the scream
of wind grew louder outside the rattling cars. I was nearly
asleep when there came a sudden shock, and the conductor&#8217;s
voice rang out warning us to leave the train. At slackened
speed we had run into a snow block, and the wedge-headed
plow was going, so he said, to plug the drifts under a full
pressure, and butt her right straight through.</p>
<p>Shivering to the backbone, I dropped from the platform
into two feet of snow, and after floundering through it I
halted among a group of excited men behind the two huge
locomotives. For a newcomer it was a striking scene. The
snow had ceased, and watery moonlight lit up the great
white plain, in the midst of which, with the black smoke
of the engines drifting across under a double column of
roaring steam, stood the illuminated train. There was nothing
else to show that man had ever been there before, except
the spectral row of telegraph posts that dwindled in long
perspective to the horizon. Ahead a billowy drift which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
filled a hollow rose level with the wedge-shape framing on
the snow-plow front. They run both better plows and
more luxurious Colonist cars now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they get through?&#8221; I asked a tall man in fur
robes with whom I had chatted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you just bet they will,&#8221; he answered cheerfully.
&#8220;Jim Grant and Number Sixty are a very bad pair to beat;
he&#8217;ll either jump the track or rush her through it. He&#8217;s
backing her out now for the first lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a clang of the bell to warn us off the line, the
coupled engines slowly shoved the long train back the way
they had come. Then the roar of blown-off steam grew
still, and with loud blasts from the funnels that rapidly
quickened they swept again down the slight grade like
snorting giants, the huge head-lamp casting a blaze of radiance
before them. It went out suddenly; I heard the thud
of a soft but heavy shock, and long waves of whiteness
curled up, while above it there was a hurling aloft of red
sparks from the twin funnels. Then the tail-light glimmered
more brightly as it returned again, and we looked
into the steep hollow with rammed-back slopes out of which
the engines backed slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll do it sure next time,&#8221; said the passenger.
&#8220;Grant&#8217;s going right back to Winnipeg to get on speed
enough;&#8221; and under an eddying blast of steam the massive
locomotives charged past us once more, while I felt a thrill
as I watched them, and envied Grant, the engineer. It was
something to hold that power in the hollow of one&#8217;s hand.
Thick white powder whirled aloft like smoke before them,
a filmy wavy mass that seemed alive rolled aside, while
presently the whistle boomed in triumph, and there was an
exultant shout from the passengers, for steam had vanquished
the snow, and the road lay open before us. Blundering
down the gap they had made I climbed on board the train,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
colder than ever. As my new friend seemed a native of
the neighborhood, I asked him whether he knew the farmer
to whom I was going to offer my services.</p>
<p>He laughed as he answered: &#8220;I ought to. Beat me
badly over a deal in stock he did. Old Coombs is a Britisher,
and a precious low-grade specimen. Dare say he&#8217;ll take you,
but stick him for half as much again as he offers you, and
bargain <i>ex</i> harvest&mdash;you&#8217;ll get double wages anywhere then&mdash;see?
How does this great country strike you&mdash;don&#8217;t
think much of it?&mdash;well, go slow and steady and it will
grow on you. It&#8217;s good enough for me, and I was raised on
the best land in Ontario.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was not encouraging, but I knew that most beginnings
are unpleasant, and I went shivering to sleep until in
the gray twilight of what might have been a mid-winter
dawn a blast of the whistle awakened me and the brakes
began to scream. The train ran slowly past an edifice resembling
a sod stable with one light in it, stopped, and the
conductor strode into the car. Even now the Western railroad
conductor is a personage, but he might have been an
emperor then, and this particular specimen had lorded it
over the Colonist passengers in a manner that for several
days had made me long to rebuke him. It was foolish, of
course, but I was as yet new to the ways of the country,
and I fear we were always a somewhat combative family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any one for Elktail? Jump off; we can&#8217;t wait all
night with the west-bound mail,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Say you,&#8221;
looking at me, &#8220;you had an Elktail ticket. Why aren&#8217;t you
getting off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Vermont I am bound for,&#8221; I answered sleepily.
&#8220;You will see it on my ticket if you look in your wallet;&#8221;
but this, of course, the magnate refused to do, and when
another hoot of the whistle announced the engineer&#8217;s impatience
he called a brakeman, saying:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are bound for Elktail, and we&#8217;ve no time for fooling.
Won&#8217;t get off? Well, we&#8217;ll soon put you,&#8221; and,
grasping my shoulder, he hustled me toward the platform of
the car.</p>
<p>Now, though Martin Lorimer sometimes gave way to
outbreaks of indignation, he was fond of impressing the fact
on me that if forced into a quarrel one should take the
first steps deliberately. Also, even then I remembered that
Coombs&#8217; homestead lay almost as near Elktail, and a happy
thought struck me. So I offered but little resistance until,
as we stood on the platform, the brakeman or some one
waved a lantern; then, while with a shock of couplings the
cars commenced to move, I gripped the guard-rail with one
hand and held the other ready, for I had determined if I
left that train before I reached Vermont the conductor
should certainly leave it too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Off with you!&#8221; he shouted, and shook me by the
shoulder; but I seized him by the waist&mdash;the cars were
moving faster now&mdash;and then flung myself off backward
into the snow. I fell softly for as it happened the conductor
fell under me, and, profiting by experience hardly earned
in several colliery disputes, I took the precaution of sitting
on him before he could get up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be my fault if you get hurt because you don&#8217;t
keep still,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Then there was a roar of laughter close by, and staring
breathless down the track I saw the tail-light of the train
grow dimmer across the prairie until it stopped and came
swinging toward us again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have lost five dollars than missed that,&#8221; said
my new friend, rubbing his hands. &#8220;Not bad for a raw
Britisher&mdash;put the boss conductor off his own train and
held up the Vancouver mail! Say, what are you going to
do with him, sonny?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He can get up, and learn to be civil,&#8221; I answered
grimly; and when the man did so, sullenly, the other said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want any mess-up with the brakeman, so
we may as well walk out now that they&#8217;re coming back for
him. Only one man in this shanty, and he wouldn&#8217;t turn
out unless it were a director. Leave your baggage where
they dumped it&mdash;can&#8217;t move it until daylight&mdash;and come
along with me!&#8221;</p>
<p>I did so somewhat regretfully, for I felt just then that
if this was the way they welcomed the emigrant in that
country it would be a relief to do battle with the whole of
them. Afterward I learned that when one understands his
ways, which is difficult to do at first, there are many good
qualities in the Western railroad-man. Still, I always wondered
why the friendless newcomer should be considered a
fair mark for petty hostility, especially by those who formerly
were poor themselves&mdash;all of which applies only to city-bred
men who hold some small office, for those who live by hard
labor in forest and prairie would share their last crust with
the stranger.</p>
<p>We trudged away from the station, with a square block
of wooden houses rising nakedly in front of us from the
prairie, and two gaunt elevators flanking it to left and right
beside the track, which is one&#8217;s usual first impression of a
Western town. The rambling wooden building which combined
the callings of general store and hotel was all in darkness,
for the owner expected no guests just then, and would
not have got up for any one but my companion if he had.
So, after pounding long on the door, a drowsy voice demanded,
with many and vivid expletives, who was there, and
then added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Jasper; what in the name of thunder are
you making all that row about? And what are you doing
waking up a man this time o&#8217; night! Hold on! You&#8217;re an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
obstinate man, and I guess you&#8217;ll bust my door unless I let
you in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker did so, and when he had ushered us into a
long bare room with a stove still twinkling in the midst of
it, he explained that his subordinates would not serve an ambassador
before the regulation breakfast hour, and lighting a
kerosene lamp immediately withdrew. Jasper, however, took
it all as a matter of course, and when, rolled in his long
coat, he stretched himself on a settee and went to sleep, I
followed suit. Still they gave us a good breakfast&mdash;porridge,
steak, potatoes, corn-cakes and molasses&mdash;at which I
wondered, because I had not discovered as yet that there is
no difference on the prairie between any of the three meals
of the day.</p>
<p>When it was finished, my companion, who gave me directions
as to how to find Coombs&#8217; homestead, added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember what I told you about harvest, and, if you
strike nothing better, when the wheat is ripe come straight
back to me. I&#8217;m Long Jasper of Willow Creek, and every
one knows me. I like your looks, and I&#8217;ll give you double
whatever Coombs pays you. Guess he&#8217;ll have taught you
something, and I&#8217;m not speculating much when I stake on
that. You&#8217;ll fetch Jackson&#8217;s crossing on the flat; go in and
borrow a horse from him. Tell him Jasper sent you. Your
baggage? When the station agent feels energetic he&#8217;ll dump
it into his shed, but I guess there&#8217;s nothing that would
hurry him until he does. Now strike out; it&#8217;s only thirty
miles, and if you go on as you&#8217;ve begun you&#8217;ll soon feel at
home in this great country!&#8221;</p>
<p>I thanked him sincerely and departed; and, as I passed the
station, I saw that the agent evidently had not felt energetic
yet, for my two boxes lay just where they had been
flung out beside the track. As a preliminary experience it
was all somewhat daunting, and the country forbidding,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
raw, even more unfinished than smoke-blackened Lancashire,
and very cold; but I had found that every one seemed contented,
and many of them proud of that new land, and I
could see no reason why I too should not grow fond of it.
At least I had not seen a hungry or a ragged person since
I landed in Canada. Besides, Carrington Manor was less
than fifty miles away, though it was evident now that a great
gulf lay between Ralph Lorimer, the emigrant seeking an
opportunity to learn his business as farm-servant, and the
heiress of Carrington.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>AN UNPLEASANT APPRENTICESHIP</h3>
</div>

<p>By this time the sun was high, and, fastening the skin
coat round my shoulders with a piece of string, I trudged
on, rejoicing in the first warmth and brightness I had so far
found in Canada. But it had its disadvantages, for the snow
became unpleasantly soft, and it was a relief to find that
the breeze had stripped the much thinner covering from
the first of the swelling rises that rolled back toward the
north. Here I halted a few minutes and surveyed my
adopted country.</p>
<p>Behind lay the roofs of Elktail, some of them tin-covered
and flashing like a heliograph; in front a desolate wilderness
where the gray-white of frost-bleached grasses was streaked
by the incandescent brightness of sloppy snow. There was
neither smoke nor sign of human presence in all its borders&mdash;only
a few dusky patches of willows to break the vast
monotony of white and blue. And somewhere out on those
endless levels, thirty miles to the north, lay the homestead
of the man who might not give me employment even if I
could find the place, which, remembering Jasper&#8217;s directions,
seemed by no means certain. However, the first landmark
at least was visible, a sinuous line of dwarfed trees low
down on the horizon; and gathering my sinking courage I
struck out for it. Slowly the miles were left behind&mdash;straggling
copse, white plateau, and winding ravine&mdash;until
it was a relief to find an erection of sod and birch-poles
nestling in a hollow. The man who greeted me in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
doorway was bronzed to coffee color by the sun-blink on
snow, and his first words were: &#8220;Walk right in, and make
yourself at home!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was thin, hard, and wiry; the gray slouch hat and
tattered deerskin jacket became him; while, if he had not
the solidity of our field laborers, he evidently had nothing
of their slowness, and with natural curiosity I surveyed him.
There were many in Lancashire and Yorkshire who might
beat him at a heavy lift, but few who could do so in a steady
race against time from dawn to dusk, I thought. Then
somewhat awkwardly I explained my business, and, mentioning
Jasper, asked if he would lend me a horse, whereupon
he called to the cheerful, neatly-dressed woman bustling
about the stove:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry on that dinner, Jess!&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, turning to me, he added: &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to the
horse, but it will be supper-time before you fetch Coombs&#8217;
homestead, and you mayn&#8217;t get much then. So lie right
back where you are until dinner&#8217;s ready, and tell us the
best news of the Old Country. Jess was born there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was characteristic treatment, and though the meal
was frugal&mdash;potatoes, pork, green tea, flapjacks and drips,
which is probably glucose flavored with essences&mdash;they gave
me of their best, as even the poorest settlers do. One might
travel the wide world over to find their equal in kindly
hospitality. Perhaps the woman noticed my bashfulness, for
she laughed as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very welcome to anything we have. New out
from England, I see, and maybe we&#8217;re rough to look at.
Still, you&#8217;ll learn to like us presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this, however, she was wrong. They were not rough
to look at, for though it was plain to see that both toiled
hard for a bare living there was a light-hearted contentment
about them, and a curious something that seemed akin to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
refinement. It was not educational polish, but rather a
natural courtesy and self-respect, though the words do not
adequately express it, which seems born of freedom, and
an instinctive realization of the brotherhood of man expressed
in kindly action. Hard-handed and weather-beaten,
younger son of good English family or plowman born,
as I was afterward to find, the breakers of the prairie are
rarely barbaric in manners or speech, and, in the sense of
its inner meaning, most of them are essentially gentlemen.</p>
<p>It was with a lighter heart and many good wishes that I
rode out again, and eventually reached Coombs&#8217; homestead,
where a welcome of a different kind awaited me.
The house was well built of sawn lumber, and backed by a
thin birch bluff, while there was no difficulty in setting
down its owner as an Englishman of a kind that fortunately
is not common. He was stout and flabby in face, with a
smug, self-satisfied air I did not like. Leaning against a
paddock rail, he looked me over while I told him what
had brought me there. Then he said, with no trace of
Western accent, which, it afterward appeared, he affected
to despise:</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not have borrowed that horse, because
if we come to terms I shall have to feed him a day or two.
Of course you would be useless for several months at least,
and with the last one I got a premium. However, as a
favor I&#8217;ll take you until after harvest for your board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the duties?&#8221; I asked cautiously. And he
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rise at dawn, feed the working cattle, and plow until
the dinner-hour&mdash;when you learn how. Then you could
water the stock while you&#8217;re resting; plow, harrow, or
chop wood until supper; after that, wash up supper dishes,
and&mdash;it&#8217;s standing order&mdash;attend family prayers. In
summer you&#8217;ll continue hay cutting until it&#8217;s dark.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>Now the inhabitants of eastern Lancashire and the West
Riding are seldom born foolish, and Jasper had cautioned
me. So it may have been native shrewdness that led to
my leaving the draft for one hundred pounds intact at
the Winnipeg office of the Bank of Montreal and determining
to earn experience and a living at the same time
as promptly as possible. Also, though I did not discover
it until later, this is the one safe procedure for the would-be
colonist. There is not the slightest reason why he should
pay a premium, because the work is the same in either
case; and as, there being no caste distinction, all men are
equal, hired hand and farmer living and eating together,
he will find no difference in the treatment. In any case,
I had no intention of working for nothing, and answered
shortly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come for ten dollars a month until harvest. I
shall no doubt find some one to give me twenty then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coombs stared, surveyed me ironically from head to heel
again, and, after offering five dollars, said very reluctantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven-fifty, and it&#8217;s sinful extravagance. Put the horse
in that stable and don&#8217;t give him too much chop. Then
carry in those stove billets, and see if Mrs. Coombs wants
anything to get supper ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was tired and sleepy; but Coombs evidently intended
to get the value of his seven-fifty out of me&mdash;he had a way
of exacting the utmost farthing&mdash;and after feeding the
horse, liberally, I carried fourteen buckets of water to fill a
tank from the well before at last supper was ready. We
ate it together silently in a long match-boarded room&mdash;Coombs,
his wife, Marvin the big Manitoban hired man,
and a curly-haired brown-eyed stripling with a look of
good breeding about him. Mrs. Coombs was thin and
angular, with a pink-tipped nose; and in their dwelling&mdash;the
only place I ever saw it on the prairie&mdash;she and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
husband always sat with several feet of blank table between
themselves and those who worked for them. They were
also, I thought, representatives of an unpleasant type&mdash;the
petty professional or suddenly promoted clerk, who,
lacking equally the operative&#8217;s sturdiness and the polish
of those born in a higher station, apes the latter, and,
sacrificing everything for appearance, becomes a poor burlesque
on humanity. Even here, on the lone, wide prairie,
they could not shake off the small pretense of superiority.
When supper was finished&mdash;and Coombs&#8217; suppers were
the worst I ever ate in Canada&mdash;the working contingent
adjourned after washing dishes to the sod stable, where I
asked questions about our employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaner than pizon!&#8221; said Marvin. &#8220;Down East, on
the &#8217;lantic shore, is where he ought to be. Guess he wore
them out in the old country, and so they sent him here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the young lad stretched out his hand with frank
good-nature. &#8220;I&#8217;m Harry Lorraine, premium pupil on this
most delectable homestead. You&#8217;re clearly fresh out from
England, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be good friends,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Coombs? Well, Jim Marvin is right. I&#8217;ve set him down
in my own mind as a defaulting deacon, or something of
the kind. Did my guardian out of a hundred and fifty
as premium, with duck, brant-goose, and prairie-chicken
shooting thrown in&mdash;and he sees I&#8217;ve never time to touch
a gun. However, I&#8217;m learning the business; and in spite
of his quite superfluous piety he can farm, in a get-all-you-can-for-nothing
kind of way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t, just because of that same,&#8221; broke in the
prairie-born. &#8220;I&#8217;m sick of this talking religion, but you&#8217;ll
see it written plain on furrow and stock that when the
Almighty gives the good soil freely He expects something
back, and not a stinting of dumb beasts and land to roll up
money in the bank. Take all and give nothing don&#8217;t pan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
out worth the washing, and that man will get let down of
a sudden some cold day. Hallo! here&#8217;s the blamed old
reprobate coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coombs slid through the stable with a cat-like gait and
little eyes that noticed everything, while Harry leaned
against a stall defiantly sucking at his pipe, and I wondered
whether I was expected to be working at something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Idleness does not pay in this country, Lorimer,&#8221; he said,
with a beatific air. &#8220;Diligence is the one road to success.
There is a truss of hay waiting to go through the cutter.
Harry, I notice more oats than need be mixed with that
chop.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out, and Harry laughed as he said, &#8220;Always
the same! Weighs out the week&#8217;s sugar to the teaspoonful.
But you look tired. If you feed I&#8217;ll work the infernal
chopper.&#8221;</p>
<p>So for a time I fed in the hay, while Harry swung up
and down at the wheel, slender and debonair in spite
of his coarse blue garments, with merry brown eyes. He
was younger than I, and evidently inferior in muscle; but,
as I know now, he had inherited a spirit which is greater
than mere bodily strength. No man had a truer comrade
than I in Harry Lorraine, and the friendship which commenced
in the sod stable that night when I was travel-worn
and he cut the hay for me will last while we two remain
on this earth, and after, hallowed in the survivor&#8217;s memory,
until&mdash;but, remembering Coombs, I know that silence is
often reverence, and so leave Grace&#8217;s clean lips to voice
the eternal hope.</p>
<p>We went back for family prayers, when Coombs read a
chapter of Scripture; and he read passably well, though,
for some reason, his tone jarred on me, while Harry fidgeted
uneasily. Now I think it would jar even more forcibly.
A hard life face to face with wild nature, among fearless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
honest men, either by land or sea, induces, among other
things, a becoming humility. There are times, out on the
vast prairie, when, through glories of pearl and crimson,
night melts into day, or up in the northern muskegs, where
the great Aurora blazes down through the bitter frost,
when one stands, as it were, abashed and awe-stricken under
a dim perception of the majesty upholding this universe.
Then, and because of this, the man with understanding eyes
will never be deceived by complacent harangues on sacred
things from such as Coombs who never lend a luckless
neighbor seed-wheat, and oppress the hireling. Much
better seemed Jasper&#8217;s answer when Harry once asked him
for twenty acres&#8217; seed: &#8220;Take half that&#8217;s in the granary,
if you want it. Damnation! why didn&#8217;t you come before?&#8221;</p>
<p>We retired early, Harry and I, to sleep in the same
room, with the rusty stove-pipe running through it; and
we rose, I think, at four o&#8217;clock; while an hour later the
feet of the big plow-oxen were trampling the rich loam
where the frost had mellowed the fall back-setting. We
worked until nine that night, and I had words with
Coombs when he gave me directions about plowing. We
do not get our land for nothing in Lancashire, and so learn
to work the utmost out of every foot of it. However, I do
not purpose to dilate upon either disc-harrows or breaking
prairie, nor even the cutting of wild hay&mdash;which harsh and
wiry product is excellent feeding&mdash;for all these matters
will be mentioned again. Still, as spring and summer rolled
away, I gathered experience that saved me a good deal of
money, and I felt at least an inch less round the waist and
another broader round the shoulders.</p>
<p>Then one Saturday evening, when the northwest blazed
with orange and saffron flame, I lay among the tussocks
of whispering grass reading for the third or fourth time a
few well-worn letters from Cousin Alice. Acre by acre
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the tall wheat, changing from green to ochre, rippled before
me; and, had its owner&#8217;s hand been more open, it would
have been a splendid crop. Marvin, Harry, and I had
plowed for and sown it, because Coombs despised manual
labor, and confined himself chiefly to fault-finding. It
struck me that if we could do this for another we could
do even more for ourselves. My agreement expired at harvest,
and already the first oats were yellowing. Coombs&#8217;
voice roused me from a pleasant reverie, wherein I sat once
more with Alice beside the hearth in England.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not dark yet, and there&#8217;s the wire waiting for
the paddock fence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I regret to see you addicted
to loafing. And Mrs. Coombs has no water left for the
kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying nothing, I smiled a little bitterly as I marched
away to carry in water, and then the lady, whose thin face
seemed sourer than usual that evening, set me to wash the
supper dishes. All went well until I had the misfortune
to break a stove-cracked plate, when looking at me contemptuously
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;How very clumsy! Do you know you have cost me
two dollars already by your breakages? No&mdash;the handle
always toward a lady! But what could be expected? You
were never brought up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the frying-pan or spider I held out had stood with
its handle over an open lid of the range, so, though nettled,
I still held it turned from her, and answered shortly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to wash dishes, madam, though my up-bringing has
nothing to do with the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>With an impatient gesture she reached over and grasped
the hot handle, then dropped it with a cry just as the door
opened and Coombs came in. This did not displease me,
for if a quarrel must come it comes best quickly, and I
listened unmoved while the mistress of the homestead said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Walter, I think you had better get rid of this man. He
not only breaks my crockery, but set a cruel trap to burn
my fingers, and I do not choose to be insulted by a hired
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you anything to say before I turn you out on the
prairie?&#8221; asked Coombs pompously; and remembering many
an old grievance I answered with cheerful readiness:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of much moment, beyond that I warned Mrs.
Coombs, and it was an accident. But it is cooler without,
and we can discuss it better there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed in evident surprise, and I chuckled when
he even walked after me into the stable, for already I
guessed that if I left before the harvest I might have trouble
about my wages. So far, in spite of several requests,
Coombs had paid me nothing. It is also possible that a
penniless newcomer of peaceful disposition might have been
victimized, but I had learned in several industrial disputes,
argued out with clog and brickbat as well as upon barrelhead
platforms, that there are occasions when ethical justice
may well be assisted by physical force. Besides, I was a
Lingdale Lorimer, and would have faced annihilation rather
than let any man rob me of my right.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid Mrs. Coombs is prejudiced against me,
and it might save unpleasantness if you paid me my wages
and I left this place to-night,&#8221; I said; and read in Coombs&#8217;
face that this was by no means what he desired. Wages
are high at harvest and labor scarce, while any one with
a knowledge of working land was a god-send at seven
dollars a month. But Coombs was equal to the emergency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret to see so much dishonesty in one so young,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Our bargain was until after harvest, and I&#8217;ll
neither pay you a dollar nor give up your boxes if you go
before. Let this be a lesson, if I overlook it, to confine
yourself to the truth.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>I forget what I answered&mdash;we were always a hot-blooded
race&mdash;but I fancy that several adjectives and the word
hypocrite figured therein; while Coombs, shaken out of his
usual assumption of ironical courtesy, made a serious mistake
when he tried bullying. As he strode toward me, fuming
like an irate turkey cock, in an absurdly helpless attitude,
I grasped his shoulder and backed him violently against a
stall. Then, and whether this was justifiable I do not know,
though I know that otherwise not a cent would I ever have
got, I took out his wallet, which, as he had been selling
stock in Brandon, contained a roll of dollar bills, and
counted out the covenanted hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to borrow your spare horse to carry
my box,&#8221; I said. &#8220;It will be sent back from Jasper&#8217;s to-morrow,
and if you venture to interfere I shall be compelled
to hurt you. Let this also be a lesson to you&mdash;never try
to bluff an angry man and put your hands up like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think he swore, I am sure he groaned distressfully
when I went out with what was due to me. Meeting
Harry I told him the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think my guardians care much about me, and
I&#8217;m coming with you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good evening, Mrs.
Coombs, you may make dusters of any old clothes I leave.
I am going away with Mr. Lorimer, and henceforward I
am afraid you will have to trust Marvin, who&#8217;ll certainly
eat the sugar, or do your own plate washing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So twenty minutes later, while Marvin stood chuckling
on the threshold and waved his hat to us, we marched out
in triumph, leading Coombs&#8217; steed which made an efficient
pack-horse. It was dawn the next day when aching and footsore
we limped into Jasper&#8217;s. He lay back in his hide chair
laughing until there were tears in his eyes when we told
him the tale at breakfast, then smote me on the back as he
said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have given a good deal to see it&mdash;the cunning old
rascal! Got your full wages out of him?&mdash;well, I guess
you broke the record. What shall you do now?&mdash;stay
right where you are. It&#8217;s a bonanza harvest, and I&#8217;ll keep
my promise; fifteen dollars a month, isn&#8217;t it? Mr. Lorraine!
oh yes, I know him&mdash;offer you the same. Then
when harvest&#8217;s over we&#8217;ll talk again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Needless to say, we gladly accepted the offer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A BID FOR FORTUNE</h3>
</div>

<p>We returned the horse with a note of sarcastic thanks,
and flattered ourselves that we had heard the last of
the matter. Several days later, however, when, grimed with
oil and rust, I was overhauling a binder, a weather-beaten
man wearing a serviceable cavalry uniform rode in, and
explaining that he was a sergeant of the Northwest Police
added that he had come in the first case to investigate a
charge of assault and robbery brought against one Ralph
Lorimer by Coombs. I told him as clearly as I could just
what had happened, and I fancied that his face relaxed,
while his eyes twinkled suspiciously as he patted the fidgeting
horse, which did not like the binder.</p>
<p>Then sitting rigidly erect, the same man who afterward
rode through an ambush of cattle-stealing rustlers who were
determined to kill him, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking ye acted
imprudently&mdash;maist imprudently, but I&#8217;m not saying ye
could have got your wages otherwise oot o&#8217; Coombs. Weel,
I&#8217;ll take Jasper&#8217;s security for it that ye&#8217;ll be here, and away
back to report to my superior. Don&#8217;t think ye&#8217;ll be wanted
at Regina, Mr. Lorimer. Good-morning til ye, Jasper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get down, Sergeant Angus,&#8221; said Jasper, grasping his
rein. &#8220;If you have run all decent whiskey off the face of
the prairie, I&#8217;ve still got some hard cider to offer you. Say,
don&#8217;t you think you had better ride round and lock up that
blamed old Coombs?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was less hard cider in the homestead when Sergeant
Angus Macfarlane rode out again, and our presence was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
never requested by the Northwest Police. Nevertheless, it
became evident that either Coombs or his wife was of
inquiring as well as revengeful disposition, and had read
some of the letters I left about, for some time later, when the
snowdrifts raced across the prairie I received the following
epistle from Martin Lorimer:</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;I return the last letter sent your cousin, and until the
present cloud is lifted from your name I must forbid your
writing her. Neither do I desire any more communications
from you. We all have our failings, and there is
much I could have forgiven you, but that you should have
used your position in the mill to ruin that foolish girl
Minnie Lee is more than I can overlook. The story has
roused a very bitter feeling, even among my own hands,
who are not particularly virtuous, and now that we are on
the eve of the elections some of the other side&#8217;s pettifoggers
are using it freely. Still, I should gladly have faced all that,
but for my own shame, knowing it is true. Her father is
a half-mad religious fanatic of some sort; he came in to
call down vengeance upon me, and I laughed at him, as I
insulted the first man who told me, for his trouble. Then
I remembered how by chance I once heard her arrange to
meet you in Winnipeg. I understand the father is going
out especially to look for you, and you had better beware of
him. Further, I have a letter from a man called Coombs
who brings a charge of robbery against you, saying it
appeared his duty to advise me. This I returned endorsed,
&#8217;A lie,&#8217; because none of the Lingdale Lorimers ever stole
anything back to the time of Hilary, who was hanged like
a Jacobite gentleman for taking despatches sword in hand
from two of Cumberland&#8217;s dragoons. If you are ever
actually in want you can let me know. If not, I am sorry
to say it, I do not wish to hear from you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>Hot with rage I flung down the letter, and, though how
it got there never transpired, a tiny slip of paper fluttered
out from it, on which I read the words, &#8220;There is a
shameful story told about you, Ralph, but even in spite of
my dislike at mentioning it I must tell you that I do not
believe a word of it. Go on, trust in a clean conscience,
and the truth will all come out some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless her for her sweet charity,&#8221; I said; then sat
staring moodily across the frozen prairie until Harry touched
me on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you have no bad news from home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I have suffered at times from speaking too frankly, but
I had full trust in Harry, and told him all, adding as I held
out the letter:</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to know me better; it&#8217;s cruel and unjust.
I&#8217;ll write by the next mail to Winnipeg and send back the
confounded money he gave me when I came out. Read
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry did so leisurely, wrinkling his brows; then he
said: &#8220;I think I sympathize with your uncle&mdash;no, wait a
little. That letter was written by a man who would much
more gladly have defended you&mdash;you can recognize regret
running through every line of it&mdash;forced to believe against
his wish by apparently conclusive evidence. Otherwise, he
would have ended with the first sentences. I should like
him from this letter, and should be pleased to meet your
cousin. In any case, apart from the discourtesy, you can&#8217;t
send the money back; from what you told me you are not
certain even that it was a present. Better write and explain
the whole thing, then if he doesn&#8217;t answer leave it to time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can still see Harry standing wrapped in his long fur
coat looking down at me with kindly eyes. In due time I
learned that he gave me very good counsel, though it was
much against my wishes that I followed it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>We worked hard for Jasper that harvest from the clear
cold dawning until long after the broad red moon swung up
above the prairie. Day by day the tinkling knives of the
binders rasped through the flinty stems, and the tossing
wooden arms caught up the tall wheat that went down
before them and piled it in golden sheaves upon the prairie.
This one machine has done great things for the Western
Dominion, for without it when wheat is cheap and labor
dear many a crop that would not pay for the cutting would
rot where it grew. Jasper, however, possessed one of the
antiquated kind which bound the sheaves with wire, and
occasionally led to wild language when a length of springy
steel got mixed up with the thrasher. Every joint and
sinew ached, there were times when we were almost too
tired to sleep, but&mdash;and this was never the case with
Coombs&mdash;wherever the work was hardest the master of
the homestead did two men&#8217;s share, and his cheery encouragement
put heart into the rest.</p>
<p>Then, drawn by many sturdy oxen, the big thrasher
rolled in, and the pace grew faster still. The engine, like
others in use thereabout, shed steam and hot water round
it from every leaky joint, and kept Harry busy feeding it
with birch billets and liquid from the well. There were
sheaves to pitch to the separator, grain bags to be filled and
hauled to the straw-pile granary, while between times we
drove wagon-loads of chaff and straw bouncing behind the
bronco teams to complete that altogether western structure.
Its erection is simple. You drive stout birch poles into the
sod, wattle them with willow branches, and lash on whatever
comes handiest for rafters; then pile the straw all over
it several fathoms thick, and leave the wind and snow to do
the rest. When it has settled into shape and solidity it is
both frost and rain proof, and often requires a hay-knife to
get into it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>So, under a blue cloud of wood smoke, and amid blinding
fibrous dust, panting men, jolting wagons, and the musical
whir of the separator, the work went on, until the thrashers
departed, taking their pay with them. Then, in the light
box-wagons which first rolled across the uneven prairie
on groaning wheels, and then slid in swift silence on runners
over the snow, we hauled the grain to the railroad forty
miles away. It was done at last, and Harry and I sat
by the stove one bitter night considering our next move,
when Jasper came in shaking the white crystals from his
furs. He saw we were plotting something, and laughed as
he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Making up your bill? We&#8217;ll square it at the fifteen
dollars to the day you hauled in the last load. Now I heard
you talking of taking up land, and I&#8217;ve been thinking some.
Nothing to earn a dollar at before the spring, and it will
cost you considerable to board at Regina or Brandon. Is
there anything the matter with stopping here? If you are
particular we&#8217;ll make it a deal and cut in three the grocery
bill. Meantime you can chop building lumber ready to
start your house in spring. No, it isn&#8217;t any favor; I&#8217;ll be
mighty glad of your company.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a frank offer; we accepted it as frankly, and lived
like three brothers while the prairie lay white and silent
month after month under the Arctic frost. Also we found
that a young Englishman who lived twenty miles to the west
was anxious to dispose of his homestead and one hundred
and sixty acres of partly broken land at a bargain. We
rode over to make inquiries, and learned that he had lost
several successive crops. Jasper, however, said this was
because he spent most of his time in shooting, while the
man who wished to succeed in that region must start his
work in grim earnest and stay right with it. Now he was
going out to a berth in India, and would take the equivalent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
of four hundred pounds sterling for the buildings and land,
with the implements and a team of oxen thrown in&mdash;at
least one hundred and fifty pounds down, and the rest to
run at eight per cent. on mortgage. It was dirt cheap at
the money, but there was no one to buy it, he said, and
Jasper, who acted as our adviser, agreed with this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to make a plunge some time, and risking nothin&#8217;
you never win,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Figuring all round, it will fit
you better than breaking virgin prairie, and you&#8217;ll pay a
pile of that mortgage off if you get a good crop next fall.
Then one of you can take up the next quarter-section free
land. More working beasts? I&#8217;ll trade you my kicking
third team at a valuation, and you can pay me after harvest.
If the crop fails? Well, I&#8217;ll take my chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>We spent one night in calculations beside the glowing
stove while the shingles crackled above us under the bitter
cold, and found that by staking everything we could just
manage it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say I could raise a last hundred from my admiring
relatives by hinting that without it I had serious thoughts
of returning home,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why, but
they&#8217;re particularly anxious to keep me away.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a ring of bitterness in his tone, and when in
due time Harry got money he did not seem by any means
grateful for it. It was long afterward before he told me
much about his affairs, and even then I did not understand
them fully, though it seemed probable that somebody had
robbed him of his patrimony. Nobody, however, troubles
about his comrade&#8217;s antecedents in the West, where many
men have a somewhat vivid history. The new land accepts
them for what they are in the present, leaving the past
to the mother country. So a bargain was made, and the
vendor received his first instalments; and as that winter
sped I looked forward, half-fearful, half-exultant, to what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
the coming year should bring. Our feet at least were set
on the long road which leads to success, and it was well that
we could not see the flints and thorns that should wound
them cruelly.</p>
<p>It was a clear spring morning, one of those mornings
which on the wide grass-lands fill one&#8217;s heart with hope
and stir the frost-chilled blood, when Harry and I stood
beside our teams ready to drive the first furrow. A warm
breeze from the Pacific, crossing the snow-barred Rockies,
set the dry grasses rippling; and the prairie running northward
league after league was dappled with moving shadow
by the white cloudlets that scudded across the great vault
of blue. Behind us straggling silver-stemmed birches sheltered
the little log-house of Fairmead, which nestled snugly
among them, with its low sod-built stable further among
the slender branches behind. Trees are scarce in that region,
and the settlers make the most of them. The white prairie
was broken by a space of ashes and black loam, with a fire
still crackling in crimson tongues among the stubble at the
further end of it. Straw is worth nothing there, so a little
is cut with the ear, and the rest burned off in spring, while
the grasses growing and rotting for countless centuries have
added to the rich alluvial left by some inland sea which
covered all the prairie when the world was young. Nature,
as those who love her know, is never in a hurry, and very
slowly, little by little, working on through forgotten ages,
she had stored her latent wealth under the matted sod
against the time when the plowshare should convert it into
food for man and beast. There is no wheat soil on the
surface of the earth to beat that of Assiniboia and Manitoba.</p>
<p>Harry leaned on the plow-stilts with a smile on his handsome
sun-bronzed face, and I smiled at him, for we were
young and hope was strong within us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, I feel a hankering after some old heathen ceremonial,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
a pouring of wine upon it, or a garlanded priest to
bless the fruitful earth,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but we put our trust in
science and automatic binders now, and disregard the powers
of infinity until they smite the crop down with devastating
hail. Well, here&#8217;s the first stroke for fortune. Get up!
Aw there, Stonewall!&#8221;</p>
<p>He tapped the big red ox with a pointed stick, the two
beasts settled their massive shoulders to the collar, and with
a soft greasy swish and a crackle of half-burnt stubble the
moldboard rolled aside the loam. I too felt that this was
a great occasion. At last I was working my own land;
with the plowshare I was opening the gate of an unknown
future; and my fingers tingled as I jerked the lines. Then
while the coulter sheared its guiding line, and the trampling
of hoofs mingled with the soft curl of clods, they seemed by
some trick of memory to hammer out words I had last
heard far away in the little weathered church under Starcross
Moor, &#8220;And preserve to our use the kindly fruits of
the earth so as in due time we may enjoy them.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a two-hours&#8217; rest at noonday, when we fared
frugally on fried potatoes and the usual reistit pork, while
Harry&#8217;s oxen waded deep into a sloo, which is a lake formed
by melting snow. Neither would they come out for either
threats or blandishments until he went in too, with a pike;
while Jasper&#8217;s broncos, which were considerably less than
half-tamed, backed round and round in rings when I
attempted to re-harness them. Still, with laughter and
banter we started again, and worked on until daylight faded
and the stars twinkled out one by one above the dewy
prairie. The scent of wild peppermint hung heavy in the
cool air, which came out of the north exhilarating like wine,
while the birch twigs sang strange songs to us as we drove
the teams to the stable through the litter of withered leaves.
An hour&#8217;s work followed before we had made all straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
there, and it was with a proud feeling of possession that
at last I patted the neck of one of the horses, while the
nervous creature looking up at me with understanding eyes
rubbed its head against my shoulder.</p>
<p>When the stove was lighted we drank green tea and ate
more flapjacks which Harry had badly burned. I remember
that when he handed me the first cup he said, &#8220;We haven&#8217;t
got champagne, and we don&#8217;t want whiskey, but this is a
great day for both of us. Well, here&#8217;s luck to the plowing
and increase to the seed, and, whether it&#8217;s success or failure,
what we have started we&#8217;ll see through together!&#8221;</p>
<p>Half ashamed of display of sentiment, I clinked the
cracked cup against his own, and Harry leaned forward
toward me with a smile that could not hide the light of
youthful enthusiasm in his eyes, graceful, in spite of the
mold of the plowing on his fretted garments. Then he
choked and spluttered, for the hot fluid scalded him, and a
roar of laughter saved the situation. Made as it was over
a cup of very smoky tea, that compact was carried out
faithfully under parching heat and bitter cold, in the biting
dust of alkali and under the silence of the primeval bush.
For an hour we lounged smoking and chatting in ox-hide
chairs, watching the red glow from the range door flicker
upon the guns and axes on the wall, or the moonlight
broaden across the silent grass outside each time it faded,
until the mournful coyotes began to wail along the rim of
the prairie and we crawled up a ladder into the little upper
room, where in ten minutes we were fast asleep on hard
wooden couches covered with skins. I remember that just
before I sank into oblivion a vision of a half-mile length
of golden wheat floated before my heavy eyes, with Grace
Carrington standing, sickle in hand, beside it. Her dress
was of the color of the ear-bent stems, her eyes as the clear
ether above, and the sickle was brighter than any crescent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
moon. Then it all changed. Powdery snow eddied through
the withered stubble, and, against a background of somber
firs that loomed above it, there was only the tall forbidding
figure of Colonel Carrington. Afterward I often remembered
that dream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST CROP</h3>
</div>

<p>Each day brought much the same tasks at Fairmead
until the disc-harrows had rent up the clods, and with
a seeder borrowed from a neighbor ten miles away we drilled
in the grain. While we worked the air above us was filled
with the beat of wings, as in skeins, wedges, and crescents
the wild fowl, varying from the tiny butter-duck to the
brant goose and stately crane, went by on their long journey
from the bayous by the sunny gulf to the newly thawn
tundra mosses beside the Polar Sea. Legion by legion they
came up from the south and passed, though some folded their
weary pinions to rest on the way, and for a few short weeks
every sloo was dotted with their plumage. Then they went
on, and we knew we should see no more of them until the
first blasts of winter brought them south again. All this
appealed to our sporting instincts, but time was precious
then, and though I glanced longingly at Harry&#8217;s double-barrel,
I did not lift it from the wall. Every moment had
its duties, and the thought of the mortgage held us to our
task.</p>
<p>Then there followed an interlude of building and well-digging,
when we sank down some thirty feet or so, and
rammed the shaft sides with nigger-head stones, while occasionally
some of our scattered neighbors rode twenty miles
to lend us assistance. Meantime, a tender flush of emerald
crept across the crackling sod, and the birches unfolded their
tiny leaves until the bluff shimmered with tender verdure
silver inlaid, while the jack-rabbits, which had not as yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
wholly put off their winter robes of ermine, scurried, piebald
and mottled, through its shadows. Then, while the wheat
grew taller, and the air warmer every day, the prairie
assumed an evanescent beauty which it presently put off
again, for the flush faded from the grasses, and only the
birch bluff remained for a refuge filled with cool neutral
shadow in a sun-parched land. It was now time for the
hay cutting, and we drove the rusty mower here and there
across the dazzling plain, upon which willow grove and
bluff stood cut off from the levels beneath by glancing vapor,
like islands rising out of a shimmering sea. On much of it
the grasses grew only to a few inches in length, and we had
therefore to seek winter food for our beasts in each dried-up
sloo, where they stood sometimes waist-high and even higher.
No making was needed; the sun already had done that
better than we could, and we merely drove the mower
through, after which I went back with the loaded wagon,
while Harry rode further out on to the prairie in search of
another sloo.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes came down in legions and bit us grievously,
until it was necessary to anoint our hair with kerosene.
Our dwelling was stifling, so that as a matter of necessity
we always cooked outside; but the temperature changed at
sundown, and, lying full length on the peppermint-scented
hay, we rode home content across the darkening prairie,
which faded under the starlight into the semblance of a
limitless dusky sea, while the very stillness voiced its own
message of infinity. Neither of us would speak at such
times. Harry had a turn for emotional sentiment, I knew,
but I too could feel that it was good to lie there motionless
and silent, and try to grasp its meaning. Then the strained
sense of expectancy would fade at the sight of the approaching
homestead, or a bronco blundering into a badger-hole
would call us back to a work-a-day world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Harvest came, and that year there was neither drought
nor untimely frost, and our hearts grew light when the
binders piled up a splendid crop. Still, when we proposed
to prepare a thanksgiving feast for all our neighbors, Jasper,
who had ridden over, grinned as he said, &#8220;Better lie low
and pay off that mortgage. You&#8217;re only starting, and they
wouldn&#8217;t expect it of you. Besides, you&#8217;ll have had your fill
of cooking before you have finished with the thrashers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This proved correct enough, for when the men came in
with the thrasher and the homestead vibrated to its hum,
others whose harvests were garnered came too, out of good-will,
and Harry was cooking and baking all day long.
Sometimes for hours together they kept me busy beheading
and plucking fowls&mdash;we turned a steam jet on them from
the engine to make the feathers come off; and it amused me
to wonder what Alice would think if she saw me sitting,
flecked all over with down, among the feathers, or Harry
standing grimed with dust and soot, peeling potatoes by the
bucketful beside his field kitchen. When the thrashers
departed our larder and our henhouse were empty, and the
grocery bill long; but we were only sorry that we could
not entertain them more royally, for the men who worked
for money at so much the bushel and the men who worked
for friendship vied with one another in their labor, and
there was no one among them but rejoiced at our success.</p>
<p>Wheat was in good demand at remunerative prices that
year, and I remember the day we hauled the last load to
the elevators. Winter had set in early, and wrapped in
long skin coats we tramped beside the wagons across the
waste of crackling sod, while the steam from the horses
rose like smoke into the nipping air. We started long
before the wondrous green and crimson dawn, for it was
nearly a twelve hours&#8217; journey to the railway town. We
reached it finally, after a tiresome ride; and then for two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
hours we waited shivering among kicking and biting teams
under the gaunt elevators before we could haul in our
wagons, and for perhaps fifteen minutes there was a great
whirring of wheels. Then they were drawn forth empty,
and presently we came out of the office with sundry signed
papers readily convertible into coin at Winnipeg, and
marched exultant to the hotel, scarcely feeling the frozen
earth beneath us in spite of our weariness. No spirituous
liquor might be sold there, but for once we meant to enjoy
an ample meal which we had not cooked ourselves, served
on clean plates and a real white tablecloth.</p>
<p>It was a simple banquet, but we felt like feasting kings,
and though since then we have both sat at meat among
railroad magnates, deputations from Ottawa, and others
great in the land, we never enjoyed one like it. Harry,
forgetting he was in Western Canada, tried to slip a silver
half-dollar into the waitress&#8217; hand, who dropped it on the
floor, perhaps because in that region wages are such that
the hireling is neither dependent on nor looks for a stranger&#8217;s
generosity. I stooped to raise the coin and hand it her,
and then started as for the first time our eyes met, while
a wave of color suffused the face of the girl who stepped
backward, for it was Minnie Lee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; I said, stretching out my hand to her. &#8220;This
is the lady I told you about. You remember the letter.
Now go along, and settle matters with the proprietor. Sit
down, Minnie, I want to talk to you. Tell me how you
came here, and why you left England, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl had lost her pink-and-white prettiness. Her face
was pale, and she was thinner than before, while there was
a hard, defiant look in her eyes. Besides, she seemed ill
at ease and startled when I drew out a chair for her, and I
too was singularly ill at ease. We had the long room to
ourselves, however, for on the prairie meals are served at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
definite hour, and usually despatched in ten minutes or so.
Few men there waste time lounging over the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly knew you, Ralph&mdash;you have changed so
much,&#8221; she said, and I only nodded, for I was impatient to
hear her story; and she had surely changed far more than I.
The Minnie I used to know was characterized by a love of
mischief and childish vanity, but the present one wore rather
the air of a woman with some knowledge of life&#8217;s tragedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost an old story now,&#8221; she said bitterly. &#8220;Father
had a craze for religion, mother was always sighing,
and there was no peace at home for me. Then I met Tom
Fletcher again&mdash;you remember him&mdash;and when he took
me to concerts and dances I felt at last that I had begun to
live. The endless drudgery in the mill, the little house in
the smoky street, and the weary chapel three times each
Sunday, were crushing the life out of me. You understand&mdash;you
once told me you felt it all, and you went out in
search of fortune; but what can a woman do? Still, I dare
not tell father. All gaiety was an invention of the devil,
according to him. We were married before the registrar&mdash;Tom
had reasons. I cannot tell you them; but we were
married,&#8221; and she held up a thin finger adorned by a
wedding-ring.</p>
<p>I remembered Fletcher as a good-looking clerk with a
taste for betting and fanciful dress, who had been discharged
from the Orb mill for inattention to his duties, and I wondered
that Minnie should have chosen him from among her
many other admirers of more sterling character.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said nothing to any one,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Tom was
disappointed about something on which he had counted.
He&#8217;d got into trouble over his accounts, too. There had
been a scene with father, who said I was a child of the devil,
and when Tom told me there was false accusation against
him, and nobody must know we were going, we slipped away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
quietly. I was too angered to write to father, and it might
have put the police on Tom. Tom was innocent, he said.
We had very little money, work was hardly to be had&mdash;and
our child died soon after we settled in Winnipeg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; I said gently, and she clenched her hands with
a gesture that expressed fierce resentment as well as sorrow
as she added:</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor little innocent thing had no chance for its
life&mdash;we were short of even bare necessities, for Tom could
pick up only a few dollars now and then&mdash;and I think that
all that was good in me died with it. So when he found
work watching the heater of a store a few hours each night,
and the wages would not keep two, I had to go out and
earn my bread here&mdash;and I sometimes wish I had never
been born.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made no answer for a space. There was nothing I
could say that might soften such trouble as was stamped
on her face; although I remembered having heard Jasper say
that a weight clerk was wanted at the new elevator further
down the line. Then, blundering as usual, I said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Minnie, they blame me at home for
bringing you out here, and I heard that your father had
sworn to be revenged upon me?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was sullen fury in the girl&#8217;s eyes&mdash;she was very
young after all&mdash;but she kept herself in hand, and answered
bitterly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like their lying tongues. Envy and malice, and
always some one&#8217;s character to be taken away. No; it was
Tom&mdash;and Tom, God help us both, has lost his head and
drinks too much when he can. But I must not keep you,
Ralph Lorimer, and henceforward you have nothing to do
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A voice called &#8220;Minnie,&#8221; and I had only time to say,
&#8220;Perhaps I can find some better work for him; and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
will write home and tell them the truth for your own and
my sake, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; before she hurried away.</p>
<p>Then Harry and I walked down to the freight-siding,
where the big box cars hauled out ready from under the
elevators were waiting. Two huge locomotives were presently
coupled on, there followed a clanging of bells, and
we watched the twinkling tail-lights grow dimmer across
the prairie. Part of our harvest, we knew, was on board
that train, starting on the first stage of its long journey to
fill with finest flour the many hungry mouths that were
waiting for it in the old land we had left behind. The
lights died out in a hollow far away on the prairie&#8217;s rim, and
Harry slipped his arm through mine, perhaps because his
heart was full. With much anxiety, ceaseless toil, and the
denying ourselves of every petty luxury, we had called that
good grain forth from the prairie, and the sale of it meant
at least one year free from care.</p>
<p>Before we turned away, straight as the crow flies a
cavalcade came clattering up out of the silent prairie, while,
after a jingle of harness, merry clear-pitched voices filled the
station, and something within me stirred at the sound.
There was no trace of Western accent here, though the
prairie accent is rarely unpleasant, for these were riders from
Carrington who spoke pure English, and were proud of it.
Two, with a certain courtliness which also was foreign to
that district, helped an elderly lady down from a light
carriage luxuriously hung on springs, which must have been
built specially at the cost of many dollars, and the rest led
their well-groomed horses toward the store stables, or strolled
beside the track jesting with one another. None of them
wore the skin coats of the settlers. Some were robed in
furs, and others in soft-lined deerskin, gaily fringed by
Blackfoot squaws, which became them; but except for this
they were of the British type most often met with gripping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
the hot double-barrel when the pheasants sweep clattering
athwart the wood, or sitting intent and eager with tight
hand on the rein outside the fox cover.</p>
<p>Still, no one could say they had suffered by their translation
to a new country, which was chiefly due to Colonel
Carrington. He had been successful hitherto at wheat-growing
on an extensive scale, and though few of the
settlers liked him they could not help admiring the bold far-seeing
way in which he speculated on the chances of the
weather, or hedged against a risky wheat crop by purchasing
western horses. Still, not content with building up the
finest property thereabout, he aspired to rule over a British
settlement, and each time that he visited the old country at
regular intervals several young Englishmen of good family
and apparently ample means returning with him commenced
breaking virgin prairie. They were not all a success as
farmers, the settlers said, and there were occasional rumors
of revolt; but if they had their differences with the grim
autocrat they kept them loyally to themselves, and never
spoke in public of their leader save with respect. Now it
was evident that his daughter was expected; they had come
to escort her home in state, and no princess could have
desired a finer bodyguard. They were the pick of the old
country&#8217;s well-born youth when they came out, and now they
had grown to a splendid manhood in the wide spaces of the
prairie.</p>
<p>Though they answered our greetings with good fellowship,
I am afraid we regarded them a little enviously, for the
value of some of their horses would have sown us a crop,
and even Harry seemed unkempt beside them. We lived
and dressed very plainly at Fairmead that year. Then amid
a grinding of brakes, with lights flashing, a long train rolled
in, and the group stood, fur cap in hand, about the platform
of a car from which a dainty figure looked down at them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
It was Grace Carrington, and as I stood a little apart from
the rest my heart leaped at the sight of her. Yet, either from
bashfulness or foolish pride, I would not move a step nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a picture!&#8221; said Harry softly. &#8220;A princess of
the prairie and her subjects doing homage to her! Ralph,
I say, you must not stare at the girl like that. But, by
Jove, she&#8217;s smiling this way&mdash;yes, she is really beckoning
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true, for a stripling who wore his deerskin jacket
as though it were the dolman of a cavalry officer strode
forward, and inclining his head said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are Mr. Lorimer, Miss Carrington desires to
speak with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason I drew Harry with me. It may have
been that I felt the company of a comrade of my own kind
would be comforting in that assembly; and then I forgot
everything as, fixing her bright eyes on me, Grace held
out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of you to meet me, and this is an unexpected
pleasure,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You must come over to Carrington
and tell me where you have settled. Oh stay, Raymond,
this is Mr. Lorimer&mdash;he was kind to me in England, and
I want you to invite him to your approaching festivities.
You will come, won&#8217;t you, and bring your friend&mdash;very
pleased to see you Mr. Lorraine, too; then I shall have an
opportunity for talking with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Delighted, of course, to please you,&#8221; said a tall bronzed
man of maturer years, bowing. &#8220;Met Mr. Lorimer already;
pulled my wagon up most kindly when the team was
stalled in a ravine. If I&#8217;d known you were from the old
country would have ridden over already to ask you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further introductions followed, all effected in a queenly
way, and with a last pleasant glance toward us Grace moved
toward the carriage, while I fancied that some of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
younger among her bodyguard regarded us jealously. Harry
and I stood silent until the cavalcade vanished into the
dimness, and then, while the last beat of hoofs died away,
the blood surged through every artery as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t she splendid! When she held out her hand to
me I felt that I ought to go down on one knee and kiss
it, and all that kind of thing, you know. Ralph, you
stalked up like a bear; must have been dazed by too much
brightness, because you never even raised your hat. Well,
one can understand it; but I think some of the others
would have liked to cut your big solid throat for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry was both enthusiastic and impressionable, though
I did not think so then, and the whole scene could scarcely
have lasted five minutes, but it filled my mind for days afterward,
and I can recall it clearly still.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>HARVEST HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a bitter night when Harry and I rode into the red
glow of light that beat out through the windows of
Lone Hollow, the furthest outlying farm of the Carrington
group, where, now that the last bushel of his wheat had
been sold in Winnipeg, Raymond Lyle was celebrating a
bounteous harvest. Round about it, drawn up in ranks,
stood vehicles&mdash;or rigs, as we call them&mdash;of every kind,
for it seemed as if the whole country-side had driven in.
Most of them were of better make than those we and the
majority of the poorer settlers used, and it was hard not to
covet when we managed to find a stall for our beasts.</p>
<p>When one has wasted precious time that in the whole
season can scarcely be made up again, by riding behind
oxen at the exhilarating pace of some two miles an hour, or
hauling in grain with half-tamed horses which jib at every
hill, it is easy to realize the advantages of an efficient team,
and any of those we saw in the Lone Hollow stables would
have saved us many dollars each year. Even in the West
the poor man is handicapped from the beginning, and must
trust to ready invention and lengthened hours of labor to
make up for the shortcomings of indifferent tools.</p>
<p>Lyle, who had heard the trampling of hoofs, met us at
the door. &#8220;It was kind of you to come, and I hope you
will enjoy yourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have tried to make
things homely, but, as you know, this isn&#8217;t England.&#8221;</p>
<p>We shook off our wrappings and entered the long lamp-lit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
hall, partly dazed by the sudden glare and warmth after
the intense cold. It certainly was different from anything
I had seen at home, for here in place of paint and gilding
the decoration was in harmony with the country, bizarre and
bountiful, with a beauty that was distinctly its own. Few
oat-heads grown from English furrows might compare with
the pale golden tassels that drooped in graceful festoons from
the wall, while among the ruddier wheat-ears and bearded
barley, antelope heads peeped out beside the great horns
of caribou which the owner of Lone Hollow had shot in
the muskegs of the north. Rifles and bright double-bitted
axes of much the same pattern as those with which our
forbears hewed through Norman mail caught the light of
the polished brass lamps and flashed upon the wainscot,
while even an odd cross-cut saw had been skillfully impressed
into the scheme of ornamentation. But there was nothing
pinchbeck or tawdry about them. Whirled high by sinewy
hands, or clenched in hard brown fingers while a steady
eye stared down the barrel, that a bridge might span a
ravine where no bridge had been, or venison help to cut
down the grocery bill and leave the more for the breaking
of virgin soil, that steel had played its part in the opening
up of a wide country. Yet, the suggestion of strict utility
even enhanced its effectiveness, and I remembered with a
smile the trophies of weapons stamped out by the gross in
Birmingham which I had seen adorning our suburban villas
at home.</p>
<p>The majority of the guests were English&mdash;one could see
that at a glance, and the mother country had small reason
to be ashamed of her outland sons. The clear skin showed
through the snow-blink&#8217;s tan, and the eyes were bright with
a steadfastness that comes from gazing into wide distance.
Sun, wind, and snow, the dust of parched earth and the
stinging smoke of the drifts, had played their part in hardening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
them, but still, a little deeper in color, a little stronger
in limb, they were the same men one finds dwelling in
many an English home. Standing beside a great open
hearth, on which to aid the stove a huge pile of birch logs
crackled joyously, the representative of an alien race drew a
cunning bow across the strings of a dingy violin. He sprang
from Gallic stock, a descendant of the old <i>coureurs</i> who for
two centuries wandered in search of furs across the wilderness,
even as far as the northern barrens, before the Briton
came to farm. It was a waltz he played&mdash;at least, that
was the time; but the music seemed filled with the sighing
of limitless pines, and the air was probably known in France
three hundred years ago. Still, weather-beaten men, and
fair women who were considerably less numerous, swept
light-heartedly round to it, and when, declining refreshment
then, we found a corner, Harry and I sat staring with all
our eyes at the scene before us.</p>
<p>After the monotonous labor of the past two years the
swish of light dresses and the rhythmic patter of feet, with
the merry faces and joyous laughter, moved me strangely.
All this seemed to belong to a different world from the one
in which we had been living, and I wondered whether any
of those dainty daughters of Carrington would deign to
dance with me. They might have been transplanted like
English roses from some walled garden at home, and their
refined beauty had grown to a fuller blossom on the prairie.
Still, I knew they would have faded in the dry heat of
the dwellings in an Eastern town.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do those French-Canadians learn to play like
that?&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;No one taught them; inherited it, I
suppose. I know that air; it&#8217;s very old, and he&#8217;s taking
liberties with it masterfully; now it&#8217;s like the cypress singing
in the big coul√©e. Of course, it wasn&#8217;t learned in one
generation, but why does a waltz of that kind unsettle one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
so, with a suggestion of ancient sorrow sighing through its
gladness? But I&#8217;m forgetting, and vaporing again. We
are ox-drivers, you and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded silently, for I had not the gift of ready speech,
and it was Harry who most often put my thoughts into
words for me. Then I grew intent as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There she is. Who!&mdash;Miss Carrington&mdash;is there
any one else to look at when she is in the room?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace floated past us dressed as I had somewhere seen
her before and could not recall it, though the memory
puzzled me. Neither do I know what she wore, beyond that
the fabric&#8217;s color was of the ruddy gold one sees among the
stems of ripening grain, while wheat ears nestled between her
neck and shoulder, and rustled like barley rippling to the
breeze, as with the music embodied in each movement of
her form she whirled by us on Ormond&#8217;s arm. He looked
as he did when I last saw him, placidly good-humored, with
the eyeglass dangling this time loosely by its cord.</p>
<p>Then I drew in my breath as the music ceased, and
Raymond Lyle approached us, saying: &#8220;As usual, men are
at a discount, but you have not had a dance, and most of the
others have. Come, and I&#8217;ll find you partners. Ah, if
you are not tired, Miss Carrington, will you take pity on
an old friend of yours? I have many duties, and you will
excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He withdrew quickly, and Grace smiled. &#8220;One must
never be too tired to dance with an old friend at a prairie
feast,&#8221; she said, running her pencil through the initials on a
program which had traveled several hundred miles from
Winnipeg. Then I felt uncomfortable, for I guessed the
letters R.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;represented my host, who had good-naturedly
made way for me. It was a kindly thought, but Raymond
Lyle, who was a confirmed bachelor living under his self-willed
sister&#8217;s wing, had evidently guessed my interest and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
remembered the incident of the jibbing team. It was a
square dance, and Harry with a laughing damsel formed my
<i>vis-√†-vis</i>, but having eyes only for my partner I saw little
but a moving mixture of soft colors and embroidered deerskin,
for some of the men were dressed in prairie fashion.
I felt her warm breath on my neck, the shapely form yielding
to my arm, and it was small wonder that I lost myself in
the glamour of it, until with the crash of a final chord from
the piano the music stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have not danced for four years!&#8221; she said as
I led her through the press. &#8220;Well, it has all come back
to you, and out here there is so much more than dancing
for a man to do. Yes, you may put down another, there
toward the end, and fill in the next one two. I have been
looking forward to a quiet talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was left alone with pulses throbbing. There was very
little in what she said, but her face showed a kindly interest
in our doings, and it was no small thing that the heiress of
Carrington should place me on the level of an old friend.
Harry was chatting merrily with his late partner, who
seemed amused at him, and this was not surprising, for
Harry&#8217;s honest heart was somewhat strangely united with a
silver tongue, and all women took kindly to him. I found
other partners and he did the same, so it was some time before
we met again, and I remember remarking that all this
gaiety and brightness seemed unreal after our quarters at
Fairmead, and ended somewhat lamely:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s out of mere pity she danced with me. As
you said, we are of the soil, earthy, and a princess of the
prairie is far beyond our sphere. Yet she seemed genuinely
pleased to see me. If it were even you, Harry!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed as he pointed to a large mirror draped in
cypress, saying, &#8220;Look into that. You are slow at understanding
certain matters, Ralph. Not seen the whole of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
your noble self in a glass for two years? Neither have I.
And it hasn&#8217;t dawned upon you that you came out in the
transition stage&mdash;a grub, or shall we say a chrysalis? No,
don&#8217;t wrinkle your forehead; it&#8217;s only an allegory. Now
you have come out of the chrysalis&mdash;see?&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of this was certainly true, for at Coombs&#8217; we had
the broken half of a hand-glass to make our simple toilet,
and at Fairmead a whole one of some four inches diameter
which cost two bits, tin-backed, at the store, and I remember
saying that it was an extravagance. Now I stared into
the long glass, standing erect in my one gala garment of
fringed deerskin.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little too bull-necked,&#8221; Harry remarked smiling,
&#8220;but, except for Raymond Lyle, the stiffest-framed man in
the room. Solid and slow from shoulders to ankles; head&mdash;shall
we say that of a gladiator, or a prize-fighter? Good
gracious, Ralph, remember you&#8217;re in a ball room, not trying
on your trousseau.&#8221;</p>
<p>His remarks were not exactly flattering, but for the first
time I felt glad to stand a strong man among those who
had other advantages behind them, though I fumed inwardly
when presently I heard Harry&#8217;s partner say:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a curious man your friend is! I saw him standing
before the big glass actually admiring himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Harry had the mendacity to assure her that this
was a favorite habit of mine.</p>
<p>Afterward I chatted for a time with the giver of the
feast. We had much in common, for he was a stalwart
plainly spoken man whose chief concern was the improvement
of his holding, and from what he said it was clear that
taking season by season his bank account increased but little,
while he mentioned that several of his neighbors lost a certain
sum yearly. There are two ways of farming in the
West, and it seemed that after all Harry and I had chosen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the better, the creeping on from acre to acre, living frugally,
and doing oneself whatever is needed, then investing each
dollar hardly saved in better implements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I saw that the men of Carrington who
followed the other plan, spending and hiring freely, were
doing a good work for the country, because even if they
lost a small sum each year most of them could afford it, and
their expenses would have been much greater at home.
They helped to maintain a demand for good horses and the
product of clever workmen&#8217;s skill; they supported the
storekeepers of the wooden towns; and the poorer settlers
could always earn a few dollars by working for them. So it
dawned upon me that it is well for the nation that some are
content to take their pleasure, as these men did, in an occupation
that brought them small profit, sinking their surplus
funds for the benefit of those who will follow them. Neither
does the mother country lose, because she reaps the fruit of
their labors in the shape of cheap and wholesome food.</p>
<p>At last the conversation drifted around to the founder of
Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;An austere man,&#8221; said Lyle, &#8220;and he&#8217;s somewhat different
from the rest of us&mdash;ready to gather in wherever
he can, very hard to get ahead of at a deal; but if he is keen
it&#8217;s all for the sake of his daughter. There are two things
Carrington is proud of, one is this settlement, and the other
his heiress. He&#8217;s not exactly an attractive personage, but
there are whispers that some painful incident in her mother&#8217;s
life soured him, and one learns to respect him. His word
is better than most other men&#8217;s bond, and if his will is like
cast iron his very determination often saves trouble in the
end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence succeeded, for bold chords of music held the assembly
still, and I saw Harry seated at the piano, which
apparently had escaped serious damage in its long transit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
across the prairie. This was a surprise, for I had not
suspected Harry of musical proficiency. There was power
in his fingers, hardened as they were, and when the ringing
prelude to an English ballad filled the room more than his
partner felt that he could call up a response to his own
spirit from the soul of the instrument. The lad beside him
also sang well, perhaps because he was young and sentiment
was strong within him, but sturdy labor under the open
heaven seems inimical to the development of hypercritical
cynicism, and the men who at home would probably have
applauded that song with an indulgent smile listened with
kindling eyes and then made the long room ring with their
bravos. Here, far away from the land that bred them,
they were Britons still, and proud of their birthright.</p>
<p>Then Grace Carrington sang, and I would have given
years of my life for Harry&#8217;s skill, which seemed a bond
between them as she smiled gratefully upon him. The
words were simple, as became the work of a master who
loved the open, and the music flowed with them like the
ripple of a glancing water; so a deeper silence settled upon all,
and I was back in England where a sparkling beck leaped
out from the furze of Lingdale and sped in flashing shallows
under the yellow fern, while somewhere beyond the singer&#8217;s
voice I could almost hear the alders talking to the breeze.
When it ceased the sound grew louder, but it was only a
bitter blast that came from the icy Pole moaning about the
homestead of Lone Hollow.</p>
<p>Raymond Lyle stepped forward to express the wish of
the rest, and Grace bent her fair head to confer with Harry,
who nodded gravely, after which she stood still, while a
stately prelude that was curiously familiar awoke old memories.
Then the words came, and from the lips of others
they might have seemed presumptuous or out of place, but
Grace Carrington delivered them as though they were a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
message which must be hearkened to, and there was an expectant
hush when the first line, &#8220;A sower went forth sowing,&#8221;
rang clearly forth. Later some of those about me
breathed harder, and I saw that big Raymond&#8217;s eyes were
hazy, while one hard brown hand was clenched upon his
knee, as in sinking cadence we heard again, &#8220;Within a hallowed
acre He sows yet other grain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then after the last note died away and there was only
the moaning of the wind, he said simply, &#8220;Thank you,
Miss Carrington. I am glad you sang it at the Lone
Hollow harvest home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would never have played it here for any one else,&#8221;
said Harry presently. &#8220;These things are not to be undertaken
casually, but she&mdash;well, I felt they had to listen, and
I did the best that was in me. I think it was her clean-hearted
simplicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was some time afterward when I led Grace out and
spent a blissful ten minutes swinging through the mazes
of a prairie dance, before we found a nook under dark
spruce branches from the big coul√©e, where Grace listened
with interest while I told her of our experiences in the
Dominion. The background of somber sprays enhanced
her fair beauty, and her dress, which, though there was
azure about it, was of much the same color, melted into
the festoon of wheat stalks below. The French-Canadian
was playing another of his weird waltzes, and it may have
been this that reminded me, for now I remembered how I
had seen her so before.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not laugh, I hope, when I tell you that all
this seems familiar,&#8221; I said hesitatingly. &#8220;Sometimes in a
strange country one comes upon a scene that one knows
perfectly, and we feel that, perhaps in dreams, we have seen
it all before. Why it is so, I cannot tell, but once in fancy
I saw you with a dress exactly like the one you are wearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
now, and the tall wheat behind you. Of course, it sounds
ridiculous, but, as Harry says, we do not know everything,
and you believe me, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace&#8217;s face grew suddenly grave, and there was a heightened
color in it as she answered: &#8220;Your friend is a philosopher,
besides a fine musician, and I quite believe you. I
have had such experiences&mdash;but I think these fancies, if
fancies they are, are best forgotten. Still, tell me, did you
dream or imagine anything more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, still puzzled as a dim memory came back,
&#8220;I saw your father too. He seemed in trouble, and I was
concerned in it. This I think was on the prairie, but there
were tall pines too; while across the whole dream picture
drove an alternate haze of dust and snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace shivered as though the relation troubled her, and
was silent until she said with a smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be that ghostly music. Louis of Sapin Rouge
has missed his vocation. We will talk no more of it. You
once did me a kindness; I wonder whether you would repeat
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would go to the world&#8217;s end,&#8221; I commenced hotly,
but stopped abashed as she checked me with a gesture,
though I fancied that she did not seem so displeased at my
boldness as she might have been. Then she answered, smiling:</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were too staid and sensible for such
speeches, and they hardly become you, because of course
you do not mean it. It is nothing very serious. There
are signs of bad weather, and my aunt is not strong, so, as
Miss Lyle presses us, we shall stay here until to-morrow
noon, and I want you to ride over and tell my father. He
might grow uneasy about me&mdash;and for some reason I feel
uneasy about him, while, as he has been ailing lately, I
should not like for him to venture across the prairie. It seems
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
unfair to ask you, but you are young and strong; and I
should like you to meet him. He has his peculiarities, so
our neighbors say, but he has ever been a most indulgent
parent to me, and he can be a very firm friend. You will
do this, as a favor, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave me her hand as she rose, and, mastering a
senseless desire to do more than this, I bowed over it and
hurried away, feeling that hers was the favor granted, for
Ormond and many others would gladly have ridden fifty
miles through a blizzard to do her bidding. It was for
this reason that I made my excuses to our host quietly, and
Harry laughed as he said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll ride over with the others
for you when the dance is finished, but that won&#8217;t be until
nearly dawn. The length of these prairie festivities is
equaled only by their rarity. But beware, Ralph. You
are a poor wheat-grower, and too much of those bright eyes
is not good for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was glad of the skin coat and fur cap before I even
reached the stables, and Jasper&#8217;s horse made trouble when
I led him out. He knew the signs of the weather and
desired to stay there, because they were not promising.
Now, though winter is almost Arctic in that region, the
snow-fall is capricious and generally much lighter than that
further east, though it can come down in earnest now and
then. Thus, swept by the wind, the grass was bare on the
levels, or nearly so, and there was no passage for steel runners,
while our poor wagon, which would have carried us
much more snugly swathed in wrappings, had broken down,
as when wanted it usually did. So, shivering to the backbone,
I swung myself into the saddle and hardened my heart
to face the bitter ride.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>HELD UP</h3>
</div>

<p>It was very dark. The wind had the coldness of death
in it, and when the lights of Lone Hollow had faded
behind the obscurity closed round me like a thick curtain.
Still, trusting to an instinctive sense of direction men acquire
in that land, I pushed on for the big coul√©e&mdash;one
of those deep ravines that fissure the prairie and much resemble
a railway cutting. This one was larger than the
rest, and Carrington Manor stood near one end of it. The
horse evidently had little liking for the journey, and did his
best to shorten it, while I had hard work to keep my mittened
hands from freezing as we swept onward through
the night.</p>
<p>In places a thin carpet of snow-dust muffled the beat of
hoofs, and there was no sound but the mournful shrilling
of the wind, which emphasized the great emptiness and sense
of desolation until I almost felt that I had ridden out of
our busy life into primeval chaos. We are inclined to be
superstitious on the prairie, which is not greatly to be wondered
at. Fifty yards from the lighted homestead in wintertime
there is only an overpowering loneliness, where Death
with his ally the Frost King reigns supreme; while, living
closer to nature, we learn that there are even yet many
mysteries, and man plays but a small part in the business
of the universe. Still, for a time the warmth within me
kept out the frost; for Grace Carrington&#8217;s hand had rested
in mine, and I understood how the thought of service sustains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the Northwest troopers in their lonely vigil. They
served the nation, but I was serving Grace.</p>
<p>Presently even this consolation grew fainter, and the
spell of the white wilderness oppressed my spirits; for the
air was filled with warning, and I knew that heavy snow
was not far off. Sometimes very silently a dim shadow
flitted past, and the horse started, snorting as he quickened
his pace with the white steam whirling behind him. It
may have been a coyote, or perhaps a timber wolf; for
though the antelope had departed south, the settlers said
that both from the bush of the Saskatchewan and beyond
the Cypress hills the lean and grizzled beasts had come
down into the prairie. Nevertheless, their noiseless passage
harmonized with the surroundings; and at last I grew
thankful for a slight drowsiness which blunted the imagination.
But there were other riders out on the waste that
night, and, with one hand on the slung rifle, I reined in
the horse as three white-sprinkled figures came up at a
gallop. Generally, as far as anything human is concerned,
the prairie is as safe at midnight, if not safer, than a street
in London town; but because game is plentiful there is
generally a gun in the wagon, and when the settlers ride
out they often carry a rifle at their back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; cried a voice I recognized; and there was a
jingle of steel as two skin-wrapped troopers of the Northwest
Police wheeled their horses on either side of me, while
another, who spoke with authority, grasped my bridle.
Even in that darkness I could see the ready carbines, and,
knowing what manner of men these riders were, I was glad
I could meet them peaceably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name and business,&#8221; said the voice of Sergeant
Macfarlane; and a disappointed laugh followed my reply
as that worthy added, &#8220;Then if ye have no&#8217; been raiding
Coombs lately ye can pass, friend. Seen no one on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
prairie? I&#8217;m sorry. Four cattle-lifting rustlers held up
Clearwater Creek, and we&#8217;re going south for the next post
to head them off from the boundary. Well, time is precious.
A fair journey til ye. It&#8217;s a very bitter night, and
snowing beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a faint clatter they vanished again; and I did not
envy them their long ride to the next post, with a blizzard
brewing. When his work is over or the snow comes down
the settler may sleep snugly and sound, or lounge in tranquil
contentment beside the twinkling stove, while, as the
price of his security, the Northwest Police, snatching sometimes
a few hours&#8217; rest under the gray cloud in a trench
of snow, and sometimes riding a grim race with death,
keep watch and ward over the vast territories. We do not
rear desperadoes on the prairie, though some few are sent
to us. Neither do they take root and flourish among us,
because ours is a hard country and there are not many
men in it worth robbing. However, there had been trouble
over the border when the rich Cattle Barons strove to
crowd out the poor man, and the hardest hit among the
latter, with murderous Winchesters, lay in wait for the oppressor.
I do not know the wrongs and rights of the whole
question; neither were details of every skirmish published
by the American press; but cruel things were done by each
side, and it took a strong force of United States cavalry
to restore order. Then broken men who had lost their
livelihood, and some with a price upon their heads, made
their name a terror on both sides of the frontier and kept
the troopers busy.</p>
<p>So I was glad that those particular outlaws had journeyed
south, and was even more pleased when I reached the
coul√©e, for the cold was increasing and the ride had grown
inexpressibly dreary. It was warmer down in the hollow
among the trees, but so black that it was the horse rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
than I that avoided them, while now and then a branch
lashed my forehead like a whip. There were cypress among
them resembling solid masses of gloom, and the wind howled
weirdly; but at last I blundered up the winding trail into
sight of Carrington Manor. The big log-and-frame-built
house was dark and silent, and though I knew that at least
the majority of its inhabitants were at Lone Hollow the
sight depressed me. Then, just as we drew clear of the
trees, I checked the horse, for, silhouetted blackly against
the sky, a single mounted figure kept watch over it. Perhaps
it was instinctive caution, or it may have been that
Grace&#8217;s uneasiness had infected me, but I led Jasper&#8217;s horse
back into the coul√©e and hitched him to a tree, then, unslinging
the rifle, stood still shivering as I watched the figure.</p>
<p>There was something sinister about it, and it might have
been frozen stiff but for a faint rattle as the horse moved its
head, while once I caught a rigid line across the saddle
which suspiciously resembled a rifle. Then, recalling what
Sergeant Macfarlane had said, I knew that while the police
rode hot-foot toward the boundary the rustlers had doubled
on their tracks to hold up Carrington Manor. It also
struck me that as the main trail ran straight across the
prairie the watcher knew nothing about the bridle-path
through the coul√©e. In any case, it was plainly my duty
to reach the homestead and render assistance if I could.</p>
<p>I made sure that the Winchester cylinder was filled with
cartridges by pressing back the slide, and then I crept cautiously,
with the dark trees for a background, toward the
building, observing as I did so that the latter rendered
the scout invisible to any one approaching by the direct trail.
Then, stooping low, I crossed the bare space which divided
me from the house, trusting that a humming bullet might
not overtake me, and reached it safely with a heart that
beat at twice its usual speed. It is one thing to face danger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
in hot blood, but it is quite another and much more unpleasant
matter to slink through the darkness wondering
whether a foe one cannot see is following each movement
with a rifle. Neither is there any chance of hitting back in
such cases; for it is my opinion, from watching a stricken
deer, that at short ranges the blow comes almost simultaneously
as the optic nerve records the flash and before the
ear has caught the explosion. All this I considered as I
flattened myself against the wall&mdash;for I was by no means
braver than my fellows&mdash;and presently, yard by yard,
wormed myself along it until I passed a corner.</p>
<p>There a light shone out across the snow from a window,
and I am perfectly willing to admit that I crawled toward
it on hands and knees, for angry voices now reached me,
and I knew that if I raised myself and the watcher had
changed his position he could see me. I reached the sill
at last with the rifle clenched in one mittened hand; and
while I debated on my next procedure I heard Colonel Carrington
say slowly and fiercely:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will neither sign nor tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, reflecting that while one can always see into a
lighted room those inside it cannot see out, I determined to
risk the scout&#8217;s vigilance, and raised my head cautiously, for
it was plain that something quite unusual went on inside.
I looked into a kind of ante-room on one side of the entrance,
which the ruler of Carrington used as an office or
study. He sat in a basket chair with a frown on his face
and disdain in his eyes, while a burly man muffled in wrappings
leaned on the table opposite him, holding a rifle, the
muzzle of which was turned toward the Colonel&#8217;s breast.
But there was no sign of fear about him, and I had heard
the settlers say that nothing living could make Colonel Carrington
flinch. An open check-book and some note-paper
lay beside an inkstand on the table, and another armed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
ruffian stood near the stove. The door of the hall close
by stood partly open, and their voices were audible through
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s quite simple, but you make us tired,&#8221; the
latter said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll tell us where the chest is, and just fill
in that check, with a letter vouching for the bearer and
explaining why you want so much in a hurry. Then,
as I said before, you&#8217;ll ride south with us a day or two while
we arrange for cashing it, after which we&#8217;ll let you go
safely, on our honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Carrington laughed sardonically, and I could
fancy his thin lips curling under the gray mustache before
he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly consider that a sufficient guarantee. Again,
I will neither sign nor tell you where the chest is. Confusion
to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a hard man,&#8221; said the other almost admiringly.
&#8220;If we&#8217;d had you to head us we&#8217;d have bluffed off Uncle
Sam&#8217;s troopers at the Cypress range. Still, we&#8217;ve no time
for fooling, and if Jim finds the chest without you we&#8217;ll
risk putting up the price a thousand dollars or so. Jim is
tolerably handy at finding things. See here, you have got
to sign it, and sign it now, before this Winchester makes
a mess of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel glanced at the rifle coolly, as he answered:
&#8220;I fail to see what good that would do. My handwriting
is peculiar; you couldn&#8217;t imitate it, while you would certainly
be hanged when the troopers laid hands on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was incontrovertible logic, and the two outlaws
drawing apart conferred with each other softly, while I
debated what I should do. The casement was a double
one, but I felt sure I could drive a bullet through one of
them. Still, even in the circumstances it looked too much
like murder, and to this day I have never taken the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
life of a man, though occasionally forced into handling one
roughly. Before any decision could be arrived at a tramp
of feet in the hall showed that somebody approached under
a burden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the muzzle on him,&#8221; said one. &#8220;I guess Jim has
found the coffer, and we&#8217;ll make sure of that. I&#8217;ll help
him to cinch it on the horse if we can&#8217;t open it. Colonel,
we&#8217;ll have to fine you the further thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>I realized it was high time for me to vacate that position
unless I wished the couple to discover me, and so I slipped
back into the shadow, just in time, as they strode out carrying
something. I watched them vanish into the blackness,
heard the scout answer their hail, and then I crawled back
swiftly&mdash;toward the door this time. A glance through
the window in passing showed me that the remaining outlaw
stood with his back toward the entrance, and his eyes
fixed on the Colonel. The door was half closed when I
reached it, and for a moment I stood there shortening my
grip on the rifle and gathering my breath; then with a
bound I drove it inward, and whirled aloft the butt of the
Winchester.</p>
<p>The outlaw twisted round on his heels; but he moved
an instant too late, for even as his fingers tightened on the
trigger the steel heel-plate descended in the center of his
face, and I felt something crunch in under it. He staggered
sideways, there was a crash as the rifle exploded harmlessly,
and before he could recover I had him by the neck and
hurled him half-choked through the door. I had the sense
to slam it and slip the bolt home; then, while I stood panting,
the Colonel prepared to improve our position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Close those shutters and screw down the wing-nut
hard,&#8221; he said, hanging the lamp close beside the door.
&#8220;Now, stand here in the shadow. I am much obliged to
you, but you should have made certain of that fellow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>It was only natural that he should feel resentment; but
there was a cold vindictiveness in his tone which made me
realize that it was as well for the outlaw that I had not left
him in the room. Then he spoke again:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have two good weapons; that rascal&#8217;s cylinder is
charged&mdash;I saw him fill it out of my own bandolier, and
there is an armory in the other room. They took me by
surprise&mdash;in Western parlance, got the drop on me. Of
course they&#8217;ll come back, but all the doors and windows
are fast, and we could hear them breaking in, while in this
kind of work the risk is with the aggressor.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pounding on the door cut him short, and a hoarse,
partly muffled voice reached us:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re about sick of fooling, and mean solid business
now,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Open, and be quick about it, before we
smash that door down and try moral suasion by roasting
both of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have stayed when you were in,&#8221; was the
ironical answer. &#8220;No doubt you have observed the light
under the door. Well, the first man across the threshold
will get a bullet through him before he even sees us.
Haven&#8217;t you realized yet that this undertaking is too big
for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse him; he&#8217;s busted my best teeth in. Hunt round
and find something for a battering ram,&#8221; cried another
voice, but though the assailants had possibly not caught all
the answer, they evidently understood the strength of our
position, for we heard them moving away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to open the chest in the stables; they won&#8217;t find
much in it,&#8221; said Colonel Carrington. &#8220;They will try a
fresh move next time. Mr. Lorimer, of Fairmead, are you
not? I wish to express my obligations again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took it very coolly, as it appeared he took everything,
and smiled curiously as, glancing at his watch, he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
half-aloud: &#8220;Well, there are worse things than a clean swift
ending, and there was a time when I should not have
stepped aside to let death pass. But I apologize, Mr. Lorimer,
for inflicting such talk on you. Hope we shall be
friends if we come out of this safely. The check?&mdash;yes,
we&#8217;ll put it away. It might have saved trouble to sign it,
but you see it was her mother&#8217;s money, and I only hold it
in trust for my daughter. Neither are we as rich as some
suppose us to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>His grim face relaxed, and his voice sounded different
when he spoke of Grace, while a few moments passed before
he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;It cannot be far from dawn, and there&#8217;s not a soul in
Carrington except you and myself. Grace took all my
people with her to help at Lone Hollow. So, unless you
are inclined to stalk them, which I should hardly suggest,
as they might be too clever for you, we must await our
friends&#8217; arrival and make the best of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no inclination whatever to try the stalking. To
take a kneeling shot at an unsuspecting man seemed in any
circumstances almost a crime; so we sat each with a rifle
laid across his knees, and for the first time in two years I
tasted excellent tobacco. But the vigil grew trying. The
house seemed filled with whispers and mysterious noises.
My throat grew dry, and the Colonel laughed when once I
moved sharply as a rat scurried behind the wainscot.
Neither of us felt inclined to talk, and our eyes were fixed
steadfastly upon the door, until at last the lamp seemed
to rise and fall with each respiration. Then the Colonel
approached the window as though listening, after glancing
once more at his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be daybreak, and I hear something,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There is probably one of them watching, but we must
chance it,&#8221; and he moved softly toward the door. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
we stood outside the cold of the morning went through
me like a knife. Still a rapid beat of horse hoofs rose out of
the big coul√©e, and it was evident that the outlaws had
heard them, for we saw two men busy with the horses at
the stable door, while two more disappeared behind the bank
of sods that walled off the vegetable garden. What their
purpose was, unless they meant to check any accession to
our strength while their comrades escaped with the coffer,
was not apparent. It was blowing strongly now, and the
air was thick with falling snow, but I made out two riders
who resembled Harry and Ormond coming toward us at a
gallop, with another horseman some distance behind. Then
a hoarse shout reached us&mdash;&#8220;Stop right there, and wheel
your horses before we plug you!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not see into the hollow beneath the wall because
it was some distance off and the snow whirled about it, but
I could imagine the Winchester barrel resting on the sods
while a steady eye stared through the sights, and knew that
neither Ormond nor Harry carried weapons. So I started
at a flounder toward them, roaring as I went:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back&mdash;for your life, go back!&#8221;</p>
<p>They evidently did not hear me, though we were afterwards
to hear the reason for an apparent act of madness.
Harry was always reckless, and Ormond coolly brave, while
as I ran I saw the two horses flying at the wall. A streak
of red flame blazed out low down in the snow, a mounted
man passed me leading two horses, and I neither knew nor
cared whether he noticed me, for I felt suddenly dizzy,
wondering whether the bullet had gone home. Neither did
I hear any report at all, for my whole attention was concentrated
on the black shapes of the riders breast high
beyond the wall. Then one beast rose into the air, and I
saw Ormond swing a riding crop round backward as though
for the sword cut from behind the shoulder. A soft thud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
followed, Harry&#8217;s horse cleared the sods like a bird, and I
blazed off my rifle at a venture toward the hollow as they
thundered neck and neck past me. It was clear that empty-handed
they had ridden either over or through the foe.</p>
<p>After that events followed too rapidly to leave a clear
impression. A pair of half-seen figures which appeared at
the other end of the hollow scrambled for the empty saddles,
and one seemed to help his companion. Then they
vanished into the whirling haze, and Colonel Carrington&#8217;s
Winchester rapped as he emptied the magazine at the flying
foe, while by the time the new arrivals had mastered their
excited beasts there was only a narrow circle of prairie shut
in by blinding snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very glad to find you safe, sir,&#8221; said Ormond. &#8220;We
met the Blackfoot who peddles moccasins, and he told us
he had seen four men he thought were Stevens&#8217; gang heading
for Carrington, so we pushed on as fast as we could.
Perhaps if we three went on with rifles we might overtake
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry looked eager, and I was willing, but Colonel Carrington
was wisest:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done gallantly,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it would only
be throwing lives away. The snow is coming in earnest,
and it strikes me they have gone to their account unless they
find shelter in a coul√©e.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they dismounted, and a hired man, who had lagged
behind through indifferent horseflesh and no fault of his
own, was despatched to prepare breakfast, and it was a
merry party that assembled round the table. Even the
ruler of Carrington&#8217;s grim face relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to make the acquaintance of both of you,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You will make the best of Carrington I hope
for a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were nothing loth, for twenty miles of deepening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
snow lay between us and our homestead, where we had
little to do, while to complete my satisfaction Grace and her
train arrived in the Lone Hollow sleigh early the next morning,
and on hearing the story her eyes glistened as she thanked
me. &#8220;I am so glad I sent you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I feel I
owe my father&#8217;s safety, perhaps his life, to you. It is a
debt I can never repay.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was late that afternoon when another sleigh drew
up before the Carrington gate, and three white-sheeted
troopers lifted a heavy burden out of it. The thing, which
seemed a shapeless heap of snow and wrappings, hung limply
between them as they carried it into the hall, while it was
Sergeant Angus Macfarlane who explained their errand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay him down there gently, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No,
stand back, Miss Carrington, these kind o&#8217; sights are no for
you. We found him in a coul√©e after yon Blackfoot peddler
had told us Stevens had fooled us, and ye&#8217;ll mind it&#8217;s no
that easy to fool the Northwest Police. He&#8217;s one o&#8217; the
gang, but the poor soul&#8217;s got several ribs broken, an&#8217; after
lying out through the blizzard I&#8217;m thinking he&#8217;s near his
end. It&#8217;s a long ride to the outpost, forbye we have no
comforts. Maybe ye&#8217;ll take him&mdash;ay, I ken he&#8217;s a robber,
but ye cannot leave him to perish in the snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung back the wrappings, and before I could stop her
Grace bent down over the drawn white face with the red
froth on the lips, while Ormond said quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Very bad, poor devil! I fancied Robin&#8217;s hoofs struck
something that yielded when he made a landing. You will
take him in if it&#8217;s only to oblige me, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace stood upright with tender compassion shining in
her wet eyes as she fixed them on the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a woman now, father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I should
like to help to cure him if it can be done. We shall
do everything possible for him, anyway. Bring him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
forward, Sergeant Angus. Geoffrey, you know something
of surgery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t make war on dying men. You will do whatever
pleases you, Grace,&#8221; the ruler of Carrington answered,
indifferently.</p>
<p>They carried their burden into another room, and I
waited beside the stove, with two faces stamped on my
memory. The one was that of the wounded man with its
contraction of pain and glassy stare, and the other the countenance
of Grace Carrington transfigured for a moment by
a great pity that added to its loveliness. Still, the coming
of this unexpected guest cast a gloom upon us, and we seldom
saw Grace, while Ormond, who seemed to know a
little of everything, once said on passing: &#8220;I have fixed
him up as well as I could, but I think a broken rib has
pierced his lung, and he&#8217;s sinking rapidly. However, Miss
Carrington is doing her best, and he could not have a more
efficient nurse.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when, on tapping at the
door in search of tidings, Ormond called me in. The daylight
was fading, but I could see the limp, suffering shape
on the bed, and Grace sitting near the window, leaning
forward as though listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light-headed at times!&#8221; said Ormond; &#8220;but he was
asking for you. Do you feel any easier now? Here&#8217;s another
inquirer anxious to hear good news of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man turned his drawn face toward me, and tried
to smile as he said: &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re very good. Hope
you don&#8217;t bear malice. You oughtn&#8217;t to anyhow&mdash;nearly
broke my neck when you fired me through the doorway.
All in the way of business, and I&#8217;m corralled now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I bent my head with a friendly gesture, for even I could
read death in his face, and the outlaw, glancing toward
Grace, added:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d known you, Missy, we&#8217;d never have held up this
homestead. White people all through, and you&#8217;re a prairie
daisy. What made me do it? Well, I guess that&#8217;s a long
story, and some of it might scare you. A big man froze me
off my land, and some one rebranded my few head of stock.
Law! we don&#8217;t count much on that; it&#8217;s often the biggest
rascals corral the offices, and we just laid for them with
the rifle. They were too many for us&mdash;and this is the
end of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace moved toward him whispering something I could
not catch, but the man smiled feebly, and I heard the grim
answer:</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I guess it&#8217;s rather too late for that. I lived my
own way, and I can die that way too. Don&#8217;t back down on
one&#8217;s partners; kind of mean, isn&#8217;t it? And if it&#8217;s true what
you&#8217;re saying I&#8217;ll just accept my sentence. Going out before
the morning; but I sent two of the men who robbed me
to perdition first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ormond raised his hand for silence, and again I could
hear the shrilling of the bitter wind that was never still.
Then he said softly: &#8220;You are only exciting him, and had
better go,&#8221; and with a last glance at Grace&#8217;s slender figure
stooping beside the bed I went out softly.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight and a cold creepiness pervaded
everything when he joined the rest of us round the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;Just clenched his hand and
died. There was some fine material wasted in that man.
Well, I think he was wronged somehow, and I&#8217;m sorry for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>We turned away in silence, for a shadow rested upon
Carrington, while the outlaw lay in state in the homestead
he had helped to rob, until the Northwest Police bore what
was left of him away. But before that time we rode back
to Fairmead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A RECKONING</h3>
</div>

<p>It was some time after the holding up of Carrington
Manor before I was able, with Jasper&#8217;s assistance, to
fulfill my promise to Minnie Fletcher. Jasper knew everybody
within fifty miles up and down the C.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Line, and
at least as far across the prairie, while they all had a good
word for him. So when he heard the story he drove us
over to Clearwater, where an elevator had been built beside
the track, only to find that the agent in charge of it had
already a sufficient staff. He, however, informed us that
the manager of a new creamery wanted a handy man to
drive round collecting milk from the scattered homesteads
who could also help at the accounts and clerking. Such a
combination might not have been usual in England, but in
the Western Dominion one may find University graduates
digging trenches and unfortunate barristers glad to earn a
few dollars as railroad hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll fix him up in that creamery,&#8221; said Jasper.
&#8220;The man who runs it was raised not far from the old
folks&#8217; place in Ontario,&#8221; and we started forthwith on an
apparently endless ride across the frozen prairie. Some of
our horses are not much to look at, and others are hard to
drive, but the way they can haul the light wagons or even
the humble ground sleigh along league after league would
surprise those not used to them. We spent one night with
a Highland crofter in a dwelling that resembled a burrow,
for most of it was underground, but the rammed earth
walls kept out the cold and the interior was both warm and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
clean. We spent another in somewhat grim conviviality at
the creamery, for the men whose fathers hewed sites for
what are now thriving towns out of the bush of Ontario are
rather hard and staunch than sprightly.</p>
<p>Still, the manager did his best for us, and said on parting,
&#8220;Send him right along. I&#8217;ll give any friend of yours a
show if Jasper will vouch for him. Pay&#8217;s no great thing
as yet, but he can live on it, and if we flourish he&#8217;ll sail
ahead with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we brought Thomas Fletcher out from Winnipeg
by joint subscription, and it cost us rather more than we
cared about, for he came second class, while at that time
Harry and I would have traveled &#8220;Colonist,&#8221; or on opportunity
would have earned our passage by tending stock. If
we could spare a dollar in those days we wanted it for our
land. The old jauntiness had gone out of Fletcher. He
looked worn and thinner, with, I fancied, signs of indulgence
in alcohol, but he professed his willingness to work hard at
anything that would keep a roof over Minnie&#8217;s head. We
drove him across to the creamery, and the manager seemed
disappointed when he saw him, while on the journey home
Jasper said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been sizing up that young man. Strikes me he&#8217;s
too much like the trash you British are over-fond of dumping
on to us. Why can&#8217;t your people understand that if a
man&#8217;s a dead failure over there we don&#8217;t want him? Dare
say he&#8217;s honest, but he&#8217;s got no sand. Let that fellow sit
up and talk over a glass of rye whiskey and a bad cigar and
he&#8217;s right there; set him wrestling with a tough job and
he&#8217;ll double up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasper posed as a judge of character, and I felt inclined
to agree with him. Fletcher had not the appearance of a
vicious or dishonest man, but I fancied under pressure of
circumstances he might become one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>We built a new stable and barn that winter, hauling
suitable logs&mdash;and they were very hard to find&mdash;ten miles
across the prairie, while Harry nearly lost his hands by
frost-bite bringing in one load. Nevertheless, and there is
leisure in that season, we drove over now and then to
Fletcher&#8217;s humble dwelling beside the creamery, and were
both embarrassed the first time Minnie thanked us with
tears in her eyes. Already she was recovering her good
looks and spirits, but as Fletcher&#8217;s pay would be scanty
until spring the odd bags of potatoes and flour we brought
them were evidently acceptable. We had received help
freely when we needed it, and it seemed only fitting that
now we should help others in turn; so we did what little we
could, and, as transpired later, it brought trouble on us.
Also we managed to pay a few visits to other neighbors who
lived at any distance within thirty miles, including a few
farms of the Carrington group, where, perhaps especially
for Harry&#8217;s sake, they made us welcome, and we went twice
to Carrington Manor. The second visit was a memorable
one.</p>
<p>It was a still, starlit night with an intense frost and a
few pale green streamers shimmering in the north, but the
big main room of the Manor with its open fireplace and
central stove was very warm and snug. Our team was
safely stabled, for owing to the distance we could not well
return that night, and since the affair with the cattle thieves
Colonel Carrington had so far as in him lay been cordial.
He sat beside the glowing birch logs, silent and stern of
aspect as usual, with a big shaggy hound which I had seen
roll over a coyote with a broken spine curled up against his
knee, while the firelight flickered redly across his lean,
bronzed face. Opposite sat his sister, who partly resembled
him, though in her case the Carrington dignity was softened
by a winning sympathy. She was an old maid of a fine but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
perhaps not common type, white-haired and stately, and in
all things gracious.</p>
<p>Harry, who was a favorite of hers, knelt with one knee
on a wolf-skin rug, turning over a collection of photographs
on a low table that she might see, and she smiled at some
of his comments. Ormond leaned against the wall behind
them interposing whimsical sallies, and casting occasional
glances toward Grace and myself. Resigning his commission,
he had lately, we understood, purchased land near the
Manor. One or two other of the Colonel&#8217;s subjects also
were present. Being lighted with shaded lamps that shed
their soft radiance only where it was wanted, portions of
the long room remained in shadow, so Grace and I, sitting
near one window, could look out between the looped-back
curtains across the prairie. High over the sweep of dimly
glimmering snow hung a vault of fathomless indigo. It was
not such a sky as one sees in England, but rather a clear
transparency where the stars, ranged one behind the other,
led the gaze back and lost it in infinity, while at intervals a
steely scintillation flickered up from horizon to zenith and
then back again. Feathery frost-flowers on the window
framed the picture like a screen of delicate embroidery.</p>
<p>I do not think either of us said much, but I felt that we
had a kindred interest in the spectacle. Within there was
warmth and light and life; outside, impressive silence
reigned unbroken, with the coldness of the grave. Yet
there was one man who, poorly nourished and still more
poorly clad, had the courage to cross long leagues of frozen
prairie on foot, for presently we heard a knocking at the
door, and after an altercation with somebody outside a
stranger walked with uneven steps into the room. White
crystals sprinkled his old English coat, a most inadequate
protection against such weather, while his breath was frozen
about the collar, and the fur cap he could scarcely hold in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
one stiffened hand was of the cheap and rubbishly description
that Jew peddlers retail to the new arrival in Winnipeg.
His age might have been fifty, but he had been bent by
toil or sickness, and his pinched face was a study in itself.
Anxiety, suspense, and fierce determination seemed written
on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wanting Ralph Lorimer, who came out from England.
They told me he was here,&#8221; he said, and clutched
at the table, for, as often happens, the change of temperature
had been too much for him.</p>
<p>Then I recollected what Jasper, who had been in to
Winnipeg, told me a day or two before. &#8220;I looked in at
the Tecumseh House, and the clerk mentioned that a wild
man from the old country had been asking for you.
Wouldn&#8217;t answer any questions; a lunatic of some sort, the
clerk reckoned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as I stood up by the window I had no
suspicion of the truth, though perhaps Harry had, for,
drawing forward a chair, he said: &#8220;Feeling dizzy, are
you not? Better sit down. But before we answer I
should like to know who you are, and what you want with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has that to do with thee?&#8221; was the fierce answer.
&#8220;I&#8217;m wanting Ralph Lorimer, and if he&#8217;s alive in
Canada I&#8217;ll find him!&#8221;</p>
<p>I stepped out into the lamplight, saying: &#8220;You need
not search far. With your permission, Miss Carrington!
Now I am only a guest here. Will you follow me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The drawn face twitched, his left hand was clenched,
and the other fumbled inside the breast of the threadbare
coat as the old man turned to meet me.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; here before them all I&#8217;ll ask thee,&#8221; he said hoarsely.
&#8220;I&#8217;m Adam Lee of Stoney Clough. Where&#8217;s my daughter,
Minnie Lee, that left her home to follow thee?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>The words seemed to break in on the warmth and
harmony like a blast of Arctic cold, and sudden silence
followed them. Colonel Carrington leaned forward with
an angry glitter in his eyes, Miss Carrington watched me
in cold surprise, and Grace&mdash;well, I do not care to recall
her face. Once afterward I saw her look the same, and
was thankful that her scornful glance rested on another
man. Then, while I stood bolt upright, staring at the
speaker, and wondering how I could make the matter
plain, others intervened, for Ormond, turning toward
Colonel Carrington, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy, sir, this is not the place for&mdash;er&mdash;such explanations.
They might prove embarrassing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Carrington glanced at his sister, who followed
by the rest had already risen from her chair, beckoning to
Grace, but Harry broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Captain Ormond in part,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
this is a serious matter. We have all unfortunately
heard the charge, and in fairness to Mr. Lorimer we should
hear him refute it. It&#8217;s either a cruel mistake, sir, or
gratuitous malice, and I would stake my last dollar on
his honor. A few words will suffice.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a kindly thought of Harry&#8217;s, and the Colonel
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse us, Jessy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Geoffrey, as a
matter of fairness he is perfectly right. Now, sir, for
the space of two minutes will you restrain your impatience
and follow us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Adam Lee of Stoney Clough, however, thought differently.
I had never seen him before, but I knew him well
by reputation; for, though not born there, he was one of the
erratic ultra-reformers one may find in many an English
industrial town. They have left all regular creeds and
parties behind, and look for the regeneration of an iniquitous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
world by some fantastic new religion, or the subversion of
all existing authorities. Some, it is true, live lives of self-denial,
and die, worn out by disappointment, of a broken
heart, but the rest develop into fanatics of savage bigotry.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;ve followed him weary and hungry for many
days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t leave my sight until he has
answered me. Stop! you that sit warm in luxury, pampering
your sinful bodies and grinding the poor, you shall
hear what one of your kind has done, and judge between us.
The tale will be good for you. Shall the rich rob us of our
children, as they rob us of our bread?&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung out one arm as he spoke, and there was a rude
power in voice and gesture that commanded attention.
Neither was his accent now altogether that of Lancashire,
for Lee, as is not uncommon, would sometimes speak a
purer English than the local vernacular. Miss Carrington
glanced past him toward the door, irresolute, and Grace
leaned forward staring at him as though fascinated, while
perhaps I of all the others found the sentiment familiar.
It was the same spirit which, trammeled by poverty and
ignorance, stirs many a man weary of a hopeless struggle
for better things, and blazes into strange coruscations of
eloquence in market-square orations and from the platforms
of conventicles where men whose religion is a thing of
terror worship the jealous God of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, sit still and hear.&#8221; The words fell as though
they were an order. &#8220;I am a poor man, a maker of shoes
for the poor who could not always buy them, and I had one
daughter. She was all I had, and I wrestled with the
devil for her that she might escape perdition through the
snare of beauty. But the nephew of a rich man cast desiring
eyes upon her, and Satan helped him. He might well
be strong and comely, for he fed on the finest, while when
trade was bad half of us went cold and hungry in Stoney
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
Clough; but he was filled with the wiles of the devil and
the lusts of the flesh, so when there were plenty of his own
kind to choose among he tempted the poor man&#8217;s daughter
who worked for a pittance in his uncle&#8217;s mill. Her mother
died; they mocked me at the chapel; and I have come four
thousand miles to find him, but now and here he shall
answer. Ralph Lorimer of Orb Mill, where is Minnie
Lee?&#8221;</p>
<p>His hand was clear of the threadbare coat now; something
glinted in it, and I looked into the muzzle of a pistol.
But Geoffrey Ormond, in spite of his surface languidness,
was quick of thought and action, and with swift dexterity
gripped his right arm from behind. Then, and we were
never quite sure how it happened, though the weapon was
evidently a cheap Belgian revolver, and perhaps the hammer
shook down, there was a ringing crash, a cry from Grace, a
tinkle of falling glass, and Adam Lee stood empty-handed,
while Ormond, who flung down the smoking weapon, said
coolly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is safer with me. These things are dangerous to
people who don&#8217;t understand them, and you may be thankful
that, without perhaps intending it, you are not a murderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Geoffrey,&#8221; said Colonel Carrington. &#8220;Lee,
sit down. I don&#8217;t know what your religious or political
crazes are, and it doesn&#8217;t matter, but I have rather more
power here than an English magistrate, and if you move
again, by the Lord I&#8217;ll send you in irons to Winnipeg for
attempted murder. Mr. Lorimer, I am not inclined to
thank you, but if you have any explanation you had better
give it to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee, I learned, was a fearless man, with the full courage
of his somewhat curious convictions, but there were few
who could withstand Colonel Carrington, and, half-dazed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
half-savage, he did his bidding, while again every eye in
the room was turned upon me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minnie Lee was certainly employed in my uncle&#8217;s mill
in Lancashire,&#8221; I said slowly, &#8220;but on my word of honor
nothing ever passed between us that all the world might
not hear. She married a former clerk there, one Thomas
Fletcher, secretly, and at present lives with him at the
Willow Lake creamery. I met her for the first time in
Canada at the Elktail hotel, where she was a waitress, and
at her request helped to find her husband the situation. She
promised to write home, but evidently did not do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is perfectly true,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I was present at
that meeting. If our visitor has any doubts on the subject
he has only to ride over there and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee gasped for breath, recovered himself, and strode
toward me with fingers trembling and his eyes blood-shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know thy vain pride in an
honor that can stoop to steal the honor of the poor; it is
only women to whom thy kind tell lies. Here, before these
witnesses, tell me again, is it Gospel true?&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed half-crazed by excitement and over-fatigue,
while his relief was evidently tempered by a fear that we
might yet be bent on duping him; but I pitied him in all
sincerity, for whatever were his foibles it was evident that
this broken-down wreck of humanity with the warped
intellect loved his daughter, and as I wondered what would
most quickly set his mind at rest Harry said stiffly:</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not lie to any one, and we are poor men, too.
At least we work for a bare living harder than many English
poor. On his friend&#8217;s word as&mdash;well, in deference to your
prejudices, we&#8217;ll say an honest man&mdash;Mr. Lorimer has
told you nothing but the truth. You will find Mrs.
Fletcher safe and well at the Willow Lake creamery.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going there now,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I
thank thee for the story. No, I don&#8217;t want the pistol. It
was the devil tempted me to bring it, but it was only to
force the truth from him, and it went off of itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are somewhat premature,&#8221; said Colonel Carrington.
&#8220;We haven&#8217;t quite done with you. As I said, I hold
myself responsible for the peace of Carrington, and though
I am inclined to believe it was an accident, you can&#8217;t ride
twenty miles hungry at midnight. You came here without
my invitation, and you have customs of your own, but
you&#8217;ll certainly get lost and frozen on the prairie if you
leave this house before to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood facing each other, a curious contrast, the
pinched and bowed cobbler and the army officer, but there was
the same stubborn pride in both; for with a quaint dignity,
which in some measure covered its discourtesy, the former
made answer in the tongue of the spinning country:</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank thee, but I take no favors from the rich. Thou
and the others like thee have all the smooth things in this
life, though even they cannot escape the bitterness that is
hidden under them. Well, maybe thou&#8217;lt find a difference
in the next. Good night to thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>He marched out, and we heard the door crash to.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say he is right,&#8221; the Colonel said, with a curious
smile. &#8220;At times I almost hope we will. An interesting
character, slightly mad, I think; heard of such people, but
I never met them.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was evidently true, for the lot of Colonel Carrington
had not been cast among the alleys of a spinning
town where the heavens are blackened by factory smoke,
and as the silver value changes in the East there is hunger
among the operatives. In such places the mind of many a
thinking man, worn keen as it were by poor living, sickened
by foulness and monotony, makes fantastic efforts to reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
beyond its environment, and occasionally hurries its owner
to the brink of what some call insanity, and perhaps is not so.</p>
<p>Then one lonely and pathetic figure, with bent head
and shambling gait, grew smaller down the great white
waste of prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry for him,&#8221; Grace said, &#8220;but the poor
old man will never reach Willow Lake on foot, even if he
could find the way. He must have walked many miles
already, and he will be frozen before morning. Some one
must go after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will allow us, Miss Carrington, I think we had
better take our leave and drive him there on our homeward
way. I am sorry that all this happened under your roof,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;Harry, we must hurry before we lose him;&#8221; and
Colonel Carrington answered coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am inclined to agree with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brief leavetakings followed. Miss Carrington was cordial,
but, and it may have been exaggeration of sentiment, I
dare not look at Grace with the shadow of such a charge
hanging over me. Neither, I think, did the Colonel shake
hands with me; and when the sleigh sped hissing down
the beaten trail Harry said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, you almost make one angry. Of course, she
is too high for you; but there was no reason you should
look like a convicted felon when we took the trouble to
demonstrate your innocence. Confusion to Thomas Fletcher
and all his works, I say! Why should that invertebrate
wastrel have turned up to plague us so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some time had elapsed before we got the horses harnessed,
because they objected strenuously, and several branching
trails crossed the prairie, so we spent a much longer
time than I liked in driving through the bitter cold before
we found my late accuser sitting under a copse of willows,
and apparently awaiting his death. As the settlers say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
when it freezes on the prairie, you can&#8217;t fool with that
kind of cold. Harry for some reason swore profanely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get in, and we&#8217;ll take you straight to Willow Lake,&#8221;
he said, lifting the unfortunate man, who already had
almost lost the use of his limbs, and who answered with
his teeth chattering:</p>
<p>&#8220;You two are very good; I couldn&#8217;t drag myself further;
walked there from Elktail to-day, and I felt main drowsy.
What brought thee after me? From one of thy sort I
never expected it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you expected,&#8221; said Harry briefly, &#8220;so
you needn&#8217;t trouble to tell me. Get into these furs here
before you freeze to death; another half-hour would have
made an end of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team already had traveled far that day, but they
responded gallantly to Harry&#8217;s encouragement. The cold
bit deep, however, and I could scarcely move a limb when,
toward midnight, with a hiss of runners and a jingle of
bells, we came into sight of Fletcher&#8217;s shanty by Willow
Lake. As luck would have it a light still shone in the
window, and he opened the door when Harry and I made
shift to draw some wrappings over the team. It grieved
me to leave the poor beasts waiting there, for I found it
difficult even to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Lorimer, Minnie,&#8221; Fletcher shouted; and
before I could intervene a woman&#8217;s shape filled the lighted
door, while Harry said softly, &#8220;Confound it! I hoped to
have got out before the play commenced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have brought you a visitor, Minnie,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You
must not be surprised. There&#8217;s nothing too strange to
happen in a new country. Harry, help me with him;&#8221;
and between us we half carried Lee inside, for all the
strength had gone out of him. The hot room reeled about
me, and there was a drumming in my head, but with an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
effort, I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s your father, Minnie. You forgot the
letter, and he came over to Carrington in search of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped the stove-iron in her hand with a startled
cry. Fletcher blinked at us stupidly, and the old man sat
down with one elbow on the table and his head drooping
forward limply, while for a moment or two afterward no
one moved, and the ticking of a nickeled clock almost
maddened me. Then the woman came forward timidly
with the word &#8220;Father&#8221; on her lips, and Lee, groaning as
though in pain, checked her with a gesture. &#8220;Who is this
man here, lass?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband, Thomas Fletcher; you ought to remember
him. We were married before I left home,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Harry coughed, while Lee said hoarsely: &#8220;I thank the
Lord for it; lass, thou hast acted cruelly, but we&#8217;ll say no
more of that. I&#8217;ve left all I had to find thee, and now I&#8217;m
only glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were tears in Minnie&#8217;s eyes as she leaned over
him with one arm round his shoulder, but I fancied there
was a flash of resentment in them too.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had listened that night before you said what
you did, all might have been different,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m so glad to see you, and hungry for news. How
did you leave mother, and the shop? I don&#8217;t care to hear
about the chapel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy mother is dead. The Lord took her,&#8221; the old
man answered solemnly, though as yet the warmth brought
only pain to him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hear no word against the chapel.
Nay,&#8221; as the woman straightened herself with a cry, &#8220;she
grieved sorely; but it was the typhoid, and to the last she
would hear no ill of thee. The shop, I sold it; and maybe
there&#8217;s harness to mend, and saddles, that will earn my
bread in this country. I&#8217;m an old broken man, and a little
will content me. A weary time of struggle and black shame
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
I&#8217;ve suffered for thee; but now there&#8217;s nought that matters
when I find thee so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Our team is freezing and we
can&#8217;t afford to lose it;&#8221; and Minnie, touching her
father, said, &#8220;You should thank Mr. Lorimer. Forty miles
at least he has driven to-day, and there&#8217;s another fifteen
before him;&#8221; but ere he could turn I bundled Harry out
of the door, and two minutes later we were flying across
the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the old man,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Fletcher
didn&#8217;t look delighted, and perhaps it&#8217;s not to be wondered
at. As to Minnie, she&#8217;ll probably cry over him all night;
but I hardly fancy she has quite forgiven him. It&#8217;s not a
nice thing, either, when you think of it. And I suppose
it cost the old fanatic a fearful wrench to give up what
he considered his mission to reform that benighted town.
Lord, what fools&mdash;it&#8217;s true&mdash;we mortals are.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was too drowsy and cold to answer, and how we got
the team into the stables or even found Fairmead I do
not remember; but we probably did it by force of habit, and
it was high noon the next day before we awakened.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A FORWARD POLICY</h3>
</div>

<p>Grace and I met often again before the thaw in spring
put an end to all thoughts of amusement. Each time
she seemed to place me on a more friendly footing, and I laid
myself out to cultivate the good-will of the Carrington
settlers, in the hope of meeting her at their gatherings, for
they at least enjoyed themselves during the winter. Some
of the younger gallants regarded me with evident hostility;
but I could afford to smile at them, because, though the
heiress of Carrington was gracious to all, she seemed to
find more pleasure in my company than in their attentions.
Still, at last even Harry grumbled when, half-frozen and
with a worn-out team, I reached Fairmead at dawn.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll want another pair of horses if this is to continue,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Ralph, it&#8217;s not my business, but I&#8217;m afraid you
are laying up trouble for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were, however, disappointments, for now and then
I drove long leagues through whirling snow or bitter frost
only to find that Grace was not present, and it was on
one of these occasions that I betrayed my secret to her
aunt, Miss Carrington. She had been visiting an outlying
farm, and though there were others upon whom the duty
devolved I insisted on driving her home. In my case it
was an inestimable privilege, for by good fortune Grace
might be waiting to welcome her. I had been silent all
evening, and when with a hissing beneath the steel runners
and a rhythmic beat of hoofs we swept on under radiant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
moonlight, Miss Carrington made some jesting comment
upon it. Perhaps the exhilarating rush through the cold,
still air had stirred me into undue frankness, for I answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace was not there, and nothing seems the same
without her. She brings an atmosphere of brightness with
her, and one learns to miss it. What would this prairie
look like if a cloud obscured the moon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Carrington smiled a little, glancing at me keenly,
as she said: &#8220;A pretty simile! It was more than I expected
after your rueful looks to-night. But you are not
singular. There are others in the Carrington settlement
who think the same&mdash;young men with many rich acres
and wealthy kinsfolk behind them at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice changed, and I think the last part was intended
to have its meaning, but a sudden impulse overcame my
reason, and I answered rashly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That may well be, but there are none among them
who would work or starve for her as I should. I am only
a poor settler, but with one purpose always before him a
determined man may accomplish much. However, I didn&#8217;t
mean to tell you or any one this until&mdash;my partner and I
have accomplished something; and yet perhaps I have said
too much not to finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Carrington moved in her wrappings so that she
could meet my eyes, but when I returned her gaze steadily
it was a relief to find sympathy rather than anger in her
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have,&#8221; she said, with gentleness.</p>
<p>So, tightening my grip on the reins, I continued doggedly:
&#8220;Then, even at the risk of seeming a presumptuous
fool, you shall hear it all. This new land is for the strong
and enterprising, who will stake their best on success within
it, and with the hope I have before me I must succeed. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
while brain and sinew hold out neither drought, nor frost,
nor hardship shall turn me aside until&mdash;until I am more
equal in worldly possessions with Colonel Carrington.
Others have risen from obscurity to hold many acres, and
somehow I feel that I shall do so too. But if I owned
half the Dominion it would be little to offer Miss Carrington,
and without her my present holding would content
me.&#8221; Then I ended slowly, &#8220;I wonder whether, even in
that case, there would be any chance for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>My companion&#8217;s face was grave under the moonlight,
but she touched my arm with a friendly gesture, as she
answered: &#8220;Those are a young man&#8217;s words, and I suppose
some would call them foolish; but though I am old I like
the spirit in them. After all, even in these days, we have
not done with romance, and a stout heart is often better
than land and property. Grace is like you in many ways;
she takes life seriously, and I fancy she sees, as I do, that
some of us are spending our best on pleasure in Carrington.
My brother is a stern, proud man, and yet, as you say, the
good things come to those who can fight and wait for them.
More I cannot tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Carrington,&#8221; I answered, feeling that
for ever afterward she had made me her servant. &#8220;Now,
please forget it all until some day I say the same thing to
Colonel Carrington; and forgive me for ever telling you,&#8221;
but her eyes were troubled as she turned her face away.</p>
<p>We reached the manor safely, but I caught no glimpse
of Grace, and Colonel Carrington hardly troubled to thank
me, while Harry pitied the team when I led it into our
stable. A few days afterward, when we spent all of one
afternoon discussing finances and our program for spring,
he agreed with me when, contrary to my usual caution, I
suggested that we should make a plunge that year by purchasing
a gang-plow and hiring more horses, then, giving a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
bond on the homestead and expected crop, sink the last
dollar we could raise in sowing the utmost acreage and
breaking more sod on the free land we had pre-empted.
There was a sporting instinct in Harry which made him
willing to run risks that I generally should have avoided.</p>
<p>Now, however, I was bent on playing a bold game,
trusting in the axiom that those who nothing venture cannot
expect to win. Also, on the prairie the credit system is
universal, and though some abuse it, it has its advantages.
For instance, the settler may obtain seed, implements, and
provisions on a promise to pay with interest after harvest,
and thus he is enabled to break an extra quantity of virgin
soil. If the crop is good all benefit alike&mdash;dealer, maker
of implements, and grower of wheat; while if the grain
fails, instead of one man to bear it there are several to
divide the loss.</p>
<p>So we pledged our credit up to the hilt, and, though at
times I grew grave as I wondered what would happen if
there should be hail or frost, we commenced work in
earnest with the first of the thaw, and drilled in grain
enough to leave us an ample profit if all went well. Then
we would double our sowing next year, and, so Harry said,
in a few seasons rise to affluence. It was a simple program,
and fortunes have been made in that way; but, as we were
to find, it also leads occasionally to disaster.</p>
<p>It was a gray day in spring, and a cold wind swept the
grasses as I stood beside the double yoke of oxen and the
great breaker-plow, when Colonel Carrington, who was
passing that way, rode toward me across the prairie. While
I wondered what his errand might be, I saw two mounted
figures outlined against the somber sky on the crest of a
distant rise, whom I recognized as Grace and Captain
Ormond. The Colonel rode a splendid bay horse, and
after the first greeting he sat looking down at me ironically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
awhile, erect, soldierly, and immaculately neat down to the
burnished stirrups and the toes of his speckless boots. In
no circumstances did the Colonel forget that he once commanded
a famous regiment, and now ruled drastically over
Carrington, while I must have appeared a sufficiently
homely object, in battered slouch hat and torn blue overalls,
with the mire clinging to my leggings.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are staking heavily on the weather this year; I
wonder what for,&#8221; he said, glancing down the long furrows,
and I felt there was a warning in it, for this man seldom
wasted words. &#8220;The last time I passed it struck me that
you had better, as they say here, go slow and not risk a
surety on the chance of what you can never attain. It
takes capital to farm on a large scale, you know. By the
way, I came to tell you that we will not want the disc-harrows,
so you can keep them until your work is finished,
and as Miss Carrington&mdash;Miss Grace Carrington&mdash;is
going to England shortly we shall be occupied with preparation
for some time. This will save you from wasting
precious hours riding over just now in the busy season.
Well, I must join the others. Good-day to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled his horse with a parting salutation, a slender
figure waved a hand to me from the crest of the rise
before it sank below the skyline, and that was the last
I saw of Grace Carrington for many a day, while breathing
hard I watched the horseman grow smaller across the
prairie. Her father sometimes delighted to speak in metaphor,
and I could not fail to recognize that it was a plain
hint he had, perhaps in grim kindness, given me. For a
moment I wondered whether I should have made him listen
in turn, and I was glad I had not, for his words stung me
like a whip, and it would not have helped matters if I had
spoken my mind to him. Then, shaking myself together,
I called to the oxen, reflecting that many a formerly poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
man had married the daughter of even a greater man than
Colonel Carrington, while if it were a matter of land and
money that divided us, every extra furrow brought me so
much nearer to her. Still, I was graver than usual, even
until the plowing was done, and Harry, not knowing the
reason, commented satirically upon it.</p>
<p>The thaw came early that year, and the latter snow
had been light, while steady dry weather followed it, and
there were times when I felt that I should have given
several years of my life for rain. It came, and, though
there was not much of it, as if by magic tender grain
stood a handbreadth above the black loam, while I watched
it lengthen daily with my heart in my eyes, and I grew
feverishly anxious about the weather. Many things depended
on the success of that crop. Then suddenly it was
summer, the hottest summer for ten seasons, our neighbors
said, and I wondered how we would manage to cut hay for
our own beasts, and the teams we had purchased conditionally,
because long grass was scanty. Assistance was
equally scarce, for, seeing us reach out toward prosperity,
our friends evidently considered that we were now well
able to help ourselves.</p>
<p>It was done somehow, though often for a week together
we worked all day and most of the night, until there was
only an hour or two left before the dawn, and I lay wide
awake, too overstrung and fatigued to sleep. Once, too,
in the burning heat of noon I fell from the wagon in a state
of limp collapse, and there were occasions when Harry,
with a paler color than usual, lay for long spaces gasping
in the shade. We could spare little time for cooking, or a
tedious journey to bring in provisions, so when one thing
ran out we made shift with the rest. Still, we observed
Sunday, and once Harry laughed as he said: &#8220;I&#8217;m thankful
there is a Fourth Commandment, for without it we should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
have caved in utterly. Do you know we&#8217;ve been living on
potatoes, tea, and porridge every meal for the last ten
days? It&#8217;s doubtful whether we can hold out until harvest,
and you&#8217;ll remember it&#8217;s then that the pace grows killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time I noticed that his face was very thin
under the sun-burn, and perhaps he read my thoughts, for
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken on too big a contract, Ralph,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but once in we&#8217;ll carry it through. Still, I wish I had
been born with the frame of a bullock, like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I lay in a hide chair ten hours together that Sunday,
only moving to light the stove for Harry, or to consume
another pint of strong green tea, which is generally our
sole indulgence on the prairie. It might not, however, have
suited fastidious palates, because the little squirrel-like
gophers which abounded everywhere, burrowing near by,
fell into the well by scores, and we had no leisure to fish
them out. Neither is there any mistaking the flavor of
gopher extract. Meantime it grew hotter and drier, and I
had to admit to myself that the crop might have been
better, while Harry, to hide his misgivings, talked cheerfully
about higher prices, until at last the crisis came.</p>
<p>I awoke one morning with an unusual feeling of chilliness,
sprang upright, and saw that the first rays of the red
sun scintillated upon something that was not dew among
the grass. With a cry I strode over to Harry&#8217;s berth.
Even half-asleep he could read the fear in my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>I scarcely knew my own voice as I answered hoarsely:
&#8220;Frost!&#8221;</p>
<p>We ran out half-dressed, and when we stood by the
edge of the tall wheat, which was already turning yellow,
we knew that the destroyer had breathed upon our grain,
and that every stately head contained its percentage of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
shriveled berries. Still, it might yet sell under a lower grading&mdash;if
there were no more frost. But the frost came
twice again&mdash;and on the third sunrise I stood staring across
the blighted crop with despairing eyes, while my hands
would tremble in spite of my will. Few men had labored
as Harry and I had done; indeed, it was often only the
hope of winning Grace Carrington that sustained me, while
now I was poorer far than when first I landed in Canada.
Neither dare I contemplate what the result of my folly
would be to Harry. But Harry, who seldom thought of
himself, laid his hand affectionately on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Ralph!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, we did our best,
and there&#8217;s room for us somewhere in this wide country.
I suppose it is&mdash;hopeless&mdash;absolutely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite!&#8221; I answered, trying to steady my voice. &#8220;We
can leave it with a clear conscience to the gophers. However,
we might earn a little with the teams to feed us
through the winter, and strike out next spring for British
Columbia. The new railroad people are open to let track-grading
contracts, you know. Lend me your double-barrel;
I&#8217;m in no mood for talking, and an all-day tramp after
prairie-chicken may help to steady me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took down the old weapon&mdash;it was a muzzle-loader&mdash;and
called our little English terrier Grip. He was rather a
nuisance than otherwise when stalking prairie-fowl, but he
was an affectionate beast, and I felt glad of his company.
Then for several hours I strode on across the prairie, hardly
seeing the clattering coveys at which Grip barked furiously,
and I might have wandered on until midnight but that
when skirting a grove of willows he must most foolishly
follow the trail of a coyote. Now, the prairie-wolf, though
timorous enough where a man is concerned, is generally
willing to try conclusions with even a powerful dog, and
when presently a great snarling commenced I burst at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
full speed through the willows. It was high time, for the
coyote had pinned the terrier down, and there was barely
opportunity to pitch up the gun and take a snapshot at its
shoulder before my pet&#8217;s struggles would have ended.</p>
<p>Then I ran in through the smoke to find that the
wounded beast still held the hapless dog, and as the other
barrel was empty I swung the butt aloft and brought it
down crashing on its head. However, the coyote was not
quite vanquished yet, for I felt its teeth almost meet in my
leg, and I stumbled head foremost over it, after which for a
few moments there was a mixed-up scuffle, until with one
hand closing on the hairy throat I got another chance to
bring down the gun-butt. Then the beast lay still, flecked
all over with blood and foam, while my hands and clothes
were torn, and there were crimson patches about me.
Grip whined and licked my bleeding fingers when I lifted
all that seemed left of him, and he presented a sorry
spectacle. Nevertheless, for some curious reason that
struggle had done me good, and, carrying the dog, I limped
home with a wound in my leg, considerably more cheerful
than when I started out. I even laughed as Harry, meeting
me in the doorway, said, &#8220;Good heavens, Ralph, what have
you been doing? You look like a butcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of inherent savagery, a return to the instincts
of barbaric days,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been killing
a coyote with my hands, and I feel better for it. But don&#8217;t
ask questions; I&#8217;m almost famished.&#8221;</p>
<p>We fared well that evening, for there was no need of
hurry now, and when the meal was over we sat talking long
in the little room. Already the nights were closing in and
the coolness outside invigorated like wine, but we felt that
the sight of the blighted wheat would not improve our
spirits. So I stated my views as clearly as I could, ending
with forced cheerfulness, though I meant every syllable of it:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are not beaten yet, and if we must go under we&#8217;ll
make at least another tough fight of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Harry covered several sheets of paper with
figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are perfectly right,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;The homestead,
stock, and implements will have to go; but I think
we&#8217;ll ask our largest creditors to give us time while we see
what we can do at the track-grading. It&#8217;s possible, but
not likely, that we might earn enough to make some arrangement
to commence again. However, to consider the probable,
there&#8217;ll be a meeting of creditors, and perhaps enough
after the sale to buy us a Colonist ticket to British Columbia.
Anyway, we&#8217;ll ride out to-morrow and call on the road
surveyor.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may have been because we were young, or the suspense
had brought its own reaction, but a faint hope commenced
to spring up within us, and now, when at least
we knew the worst, we were both more tranquil than we
had been for the last three days, while I slept peacefully
until Harry roused me with the news that breakfast was
ready. We started at noon, and before the sun crossed
the meridian the next day we found the surveyor busy
beside the new steel road which stretched out across the
prairie from the trunk line so many fathoms daily. He
was a native Canadian, emphatic in gesture, curt in speech,
with, as we say here, a snap about him, and he looked us
over critically as I explained that we were willing to work
for him. I fancied there was satisfaction in his gaze, and
this was not unlikely, for we were both lean, hard, and
bronzed, while our old stained canvas garments told their
own tale of sturdy toil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I could let you a track-grading contract,&#8221; he
said meditatively. &#8220;We find the scoops, you find the
teams and take all risks, but it&#8217;s pay up when you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
through. We&#8217;ve no use on this road for the men who
when they strike a hard streak just throw up their contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we begin we&#8217;ll finish,&#8221; I answered with emphasis,
while Harry smiled and raised a warning hand unseen
by the surveyor. &#8220;Neither hard work nor hard luck
is new to us, and if it weren&#8217;t for the latter we shouldn&#8217;t
be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear it,&#8221; said the surveyor, dryly, &#8220;you look
like that. Well, here&#8217;s the schedule; glance through it;
then you can come back to-morrow and we&#8217;ll sign the
agreement. You&#8217;ll have to rustle, though, and keep the
rail-bed ready; this road&#8217;s going right through to Green
Lake before the winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran my eye down the list of stipulations respecting the
work to be done at so much per rod, with allowance for
extra depth scooped out through the rises per cubic ton,
saw there should be a profit in it from what little I knew,
and tossed the sheet to Harry, answering:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our time is precious, and if my partner is willing we&#8217;ll
sign it now. As to what we look like, I&#8217;ll thank you to
remember that has nothing to do with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize; meant it as a compliment,&#8221; said our
future employer, who was grimed thick with sweat and dust,
and Harry answered lightly, &#8220;We are much obliged to
you; my partner is quick in temper. However, you know
that you can&#8217;t get teams or men for love or money now
when harvest&#8217;s coming on, and so we&#8217;re going to strike you
for another two cents per measure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might stretch that far,&#8221; said the other after more
figuring, &#8220;but somehow we&#8217;ll take it out of you. Here,
fill your distinguished names into this, and if you like to
take it there&#8217;s another lot&mdash;it&#8217;s hauling in birch logs for
stump piles and fencing purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>We signed both papers, and on leaving the surveyor we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
found a man in old blue overalls, whose appearance suggested
the Briton, waiting for us near the construction train
which had just come up with its load of rails and rail-layers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get the grading contract?&#8221; he asked; and,
when Harry nodded, he continued: &#8220;Then as a preliminary
I&#8217;ll introduce myself, Ellsworthy Johnston, one-time barrister,
and, as the surveyor classified me, general roustabout.
Had a bush ranch in British Columbia and came to grief
over it by fooling time away gold prospecting. Rode in and
asked yonder eloquent autocrat for a contract, but he didn&#8217;t
see it. Said, and he explained it wasn&#8217;t flattery, I looked
too much of a gentleman, and in consequence if I liked I
could shovel ballast at one dollar seventy-five daily. Now
shoveling ballast grows monotonous, and one gets a confounded
back-ache over it, so if you&#8217;re agreeable I&#8217;ll fling
in a small sum and my services as junior partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not too rich,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll talk it
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a move on there, Sam Johnsing, before the flies
eat you! Guess the rails are growing rusty while you&#8217;re
resting,&#8221; called somebody in authority, and with a smile of
whimsical resignation our new acquaintance hurried away.</p>
<p>We made a bargain with him that evening, to the satisfaction
of all concerned, and the next morning Harry rode
away to divide our few head of stock among our neighbors
and hire if possible one or two among those whose
crops had also suffered from frost. The latter, like the
devastating hail, performs its work erratically, wiping out
one man&#8217;s grain and sparing his neighbors&#8217;. Meanwhile
I found plenty to do making arrangements to commence our
work on the track.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>ON THE RAILROAD</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a hot autumn morning when we prepared to
commence our task of railroad building, the last forlorn
hope between ourselves and ruin. Harry and I stood each
beside our teams, which were harnessed to a great iron
scoop or scraper designed to tear out a heavy load of soil
at each traverse. This we would pile in the slight hollows,
so that, sinking a few feet through the rises and raised
slightly above each depression, the road-bed might run
straight and level across the prairie. A group of sinewy,
dusty men waited about the line of flat cars loaded with
rails close behind, while a plume of black smoke curled
aloft from the huge locomotive in a dingy column against
the blue of the sky. This, with the cluster of tents and
shanties, was all that broke the white grass-land&#8217;s empty
monotony.</p>
<p>The surveyor, who was perhaps dustier than any, leaned
against the engine&#8217;s buffer-frame close beside me, mopping
his face, which was also smeared with soot, and surveyed us
complacently, for with our assistants we formed, as far as
outward appearances went, a workmanlike if somewhat
disreputable company. Water was scarce that season and
too precious to waste in superfluous washing, while we had
little leisure to spare on even much-needed repairs to our
garments. Still, we were alert, hard and eager, while after
the preceding anxiety it was with improved spirits that we
found definite work before us, with, what was better still,
definite pay at the end of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve finished the line posts; I guess you can
start in,&#8221; said the surveyor. &#8220;You look as if you could
keep those scoops from rusting. Good luck go with you!
Stir round and heave those rails down, boys!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then with a crack of whips we started, and it was with
satisfaction that I heard the trampling of hoofs bite into
the sod and the bright steel edges rip through the matted
roots. Soft earth and tangled grasses filled the iron scoop
behind, the air vibrated with the strident clang of rails, and
the locomotive engineer performed an inspiriting solo upon
his whistle, while the rest of our party followed to finish the
wake we left with their shovels. Somewhat improved appliances
are used in railroad building now, but though it had
limitations the scraper did excellent work in its day. All
went well and smoothly for at least a month, and our hearts
grew lighter every day, while each time the big locomotive
came clattering up we had another length of road-bed ready
for the rails, and the surveyor commented on our progress
with frank approval. He also did so to some purpose in his
reports to Winnipeg, as subsequently transpired, while occasionally,
when we lounged languidly contented under the
dew-damped canvas at nights, Harry would figure with the
end of a pencil how much we had already placed to our
credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing well, Ralph,&#8221; he said the last time it
happened, with a smile that lighted his sunny face.
&#8220;There&#8217;s enough now to pay off those people in Brandon,
and with luck we&#8217;ll manage to settle with the worst of the
rest before the frost comes. It&#8217;s almost a pity we didn&#8217;t
try the railroad sooner, but&#8221;&mdash;and here he glanced at me
with a twinkle in his eye&mdash;&#8220;we came out to work our own
land, and it&#8217;s your intention to add acre to acre until
Fairmead&#8217;s one of the biggest farms in the Territories,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered soberly. &#8220;God willing, if health and
strength hold out,&#8221; and in his own expressive way Harry
shook hands with me. Harry&#8217;s hand harmonized with the
rest of him, and hands as well as faces are characteristic
of their owners&#8217; temperament. It was small and shapely,
one might call it almost feminine, but its touch conveyed
the subtle impression of courage and nervous energy, while
I wondered what the woman who reared him would think
if she saw those toughened and ingrained fingers now.
Neither were words needed, for Harry&#8217;s actions had each
their meaning, and that grasp seemed to say that in this I was
leader and whatever happened he would loyally follow me.
Then he added softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;with your reservation&mdash;we will do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uninterrupted good fortune seldom lasts long, however,
or at least it seldom did with us, and presently the line
ran into a big coul√©e which wound through what we call
hills on the prairie&mdash;that is to say, a ridge of slightly higher
levels swelling into billowy rises. In the Western Dominion
the rivers, instead of curving round the obstacles they
encounter, generally go through, though whether they find
the gorges or fret them out is beyond me. In the latter
case, judging from what one sees in British Columbia, they
must have worked hard for countless centuries. The hollow
as usual was partly filled with birches and willows, which
hampered us, for they must be cut down and the roots
grubbed up; and when at last we had scooped a strip of
road-bed out of the slanting side it seemed as if disaster
again meant to overtake us.</p>
<p>Autumn had melted into Indian summer, but it was still
hot. With the perspiration dripping from me one afternoon,
I whirled and drove the keen axe into a silver birch&#8217;s
side, seldom turning my eyes from the shower of white
chips, because looking up between the slender stems one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
could see the black smoke of a thrasher streaking the prairie.
The crops of the man who employed it had escaped damage,
and as those of many had been spoiled by frost I knew he
would reap a handsome profit on every bushel. I did not
grudge it him, but the contrast with our failure troubled
me. My throat was parched and dried up, for we had
finished all the water they brought us in by train, and no
man could drink of the shrunken creek, which was alkaline.
It flowed down from one of those curious lakes to be found
on the Western prairie, where clouds of biting dust which
smarts one&#8217;s eyes and nostrils intolerably rise up like smoke
from the white crust about the margin of the waters, whose
color is a vivid greenish blue.</p>
<p>I stepped aside a moment to let the construction train
with its load of rails roll past, and stood leaning on the axe
wiping the perspiration out of my eyes until Harry&#8217;s shout
rang out warningly. Then through the strident scream of
brakes and the roar of blown-off steam an ominous rumbling
commenced round a bend; there was a rush of flying footsteps,
and Harry shouted again. I ran forward down the
newly-laid track, and when I halted breathless, my first
sensation was one of thankfulness followed by dismay.
Harry was struggling to hold an excited team not far away.
It was evident that he and the rest were safe, but it was also
equally plain that we must gather our courage to meet
another blow. In no circumstances could much, if any,
profit have been made on that portion of the line which
traversed the coul√©e, but we took it with the rest; and now
the road-bed we had painfully scooped out had been swept
away and lay a chaotic mass of d√©bris, some sixty yards
below, for, loosened by the excavation, the side of the
ravine had slipped down bodily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you and the teams are safe,&#8221; was all I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
find to say when Harry met me, for I struggled against an
inclination to do either of two things. One was to sit
down and groan despairingly, and the other to abuse everything
on the Canadian prairie.</p>
<p>Harry at first said nothing. He was panting heavily,
but another man answered for him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you might be, and only for your partner&#8217;s grit
the teams wouldn&#8217;t have been saved. When we saw the
whole blame ravine tumbling in the only thing that struck
us was to light out quick, and we did it in a hurry, not
stopping to think. Something else struck your partner, too,
a devastatin&#8217; load of dirt coming down on the teams, and
he went back for them. Cut the traces of one scraper&mdash;you
can see the blame thing busted in the bottom there;
then there was a roar and she came down solid with a
rush, while we did the shouting when he brought them
safe at a gallop out of the dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a side issue,&#8221; said Harry very gravely, &#8220;and the
main one is serious. Ralph, if all this slope is going to slip
down it means disaster to us. You see, after what was said
when we took the contract, we couldn&#8217;t well back out of it,
even if we wanted to. Hallo, here&#8217;s his majesty the surveyor
on his trolley.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a clatter of wheels the light frame raced down the
slight incline, and unloaded its occupants violently when it
ran into the back of the construction train which they had
stopped just in time. We did not, however, follow it,
because we wanted time to think; and both our faces were
anxious when the surveyor returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a hard case&mdash;one of those things no man
can figure on ahead&mdash;give you my word we never expected
this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That bank looked solid enough, but there&#8217;s
more of it just waiting to go, and the whole track will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
have to be set back several yards or so. Anyway, it&#8217;s particularly
hard on you. Remembering what I told you, have
you settled yet what you are going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered slowly. &#8220;We made the agreement,
and we mean to keep it. We&#8217;ll hire more men and teams
if what we have won&#8217;t do. Somehow we&#8217;ve got to finish our
bargain, and get our money back, and we&#8217;ll come to the end
of the ravine some day. Isn&#8217;t that your view, Harry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; said Harry, as the surveyor turned in his
direction. By this time we had fallen into our respective
parts. When there was need of judicious speech or care in
matters financial it was Harry&#8217;s tact or calculations that
solved the difficulty, while when it came to a hard grapple
with natural difficulties I led the way. Again the surveyor
glanced from one to the other before he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s grit in both of you. After all, what you think
does not affect the question; a contract&#8217;s a contract, and we
hold the whip hand over you, but I&#8217;m glad to see you take it
that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The surveyor, as we were to learn, was a man of discernment,
and he may have been making an experiment,
but my blood was up, and I answered stiffly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The whip hand has nothing to do with it. We will
carry out our agreement, because we pledged ourselves to
do so; if we hadn&#8217;t, ten railroad companies would not make
us, and we&#8217;re open to defy any man in the Dominion, director
or surveyor, to force an injustice upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The autocrat was not in the least angry, and smiled
dryly as he said: &#8220;I believe you. Well, I make no promises,
but if you&#8217;re not above all assistance I guess I might help
you. You can lay off and rest your teams for two days
anyway, while I turn loose the shovelers; then you&#8217;ll want
all the energy that&#8217;s in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>In different circumstances we might have enjoyed that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
holiday. As it was, I lay still in the sunshine all day,
disconsolately staring across the prairie down the track that
was apparently going to complete our discomfiture, and
smoking until my mouth was blistered. Where Harry
went to I did not know. On the second evening, however,
our new partner, who had been back to the main line for
supplies, came in, and listened with apparent unconcern
while we explained matters to him. Acting under impulse,
I even suggested that we might release him from his unfortunate
bargain, but he laughed as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re generous, but it can&#8217;t be done. Experiences of
this kind are not new to me, and I&#8217;m a Jonah, as I warned
you. Still, when bad luck follows one everywhere&mdash;floods
on the Fraser, cattle-sickness, snow coming heavy just when
one is finding signs of gold&mdash;you know there&#8217;s no earthly
use running away from it, and it&#8217;s wisest to laugh at
fortune and stay right where you are. Dare say we&#8217;ll
come out on the right side yet; and if we don&#8217;t, in fifty
years it won&#8217;t make much difference. Now try to look less
like guests at a funeral, and talk of something cheerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made some moody answer and envied him his way of
taking things, while Harry tried to smile, and Johnston,
lifting down a banjo, commenced a plantation ditty, which
he sang with so much spirit that presently he had most of
the shovel gang for an appreciative audience. Then there
were roars of laughter when he stood in the entrance of the
tent and, with the utmost solemnity, made them a ridiculous
speech. After this they went away to their canvas dwellings,
and I knew that Ellsworthy Johnston was one of
those born soldiers of fortune who extract the utmost brightness
from an arduous life, and, meeting each reverse with
a smiling face, cheerfully bear their ill-rewarded share in
the development of Greater Britain beyond the seas. One
may find a good many of them on the Western prairie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>We recommenced work the next morning, and, under the
delicious still coolness of the Indian summer, we increased
the strain on nerve and muscle and cut down the grocery
bill, though I insisted on feeding the horses even better
than before. It is never economy to stint one&#8217;s working
cattle, especially when one demands the utmost from them,
besides being a procedure which is distasteful to any merciful
man. However, though we had to hire more horses, wondering
how we would ever pay for them when the contract
was finished, the track crept on along the treacherous
slope, where we scooped out a double width as basis,
winding among the birches in glistening, sinuous curves,
while the end of the valley grew nearer every day. Again
Harry and I lapsed into the excitement of a race against
adversity, because unless we were well out on the open
prairie before winter bound the sod into the likeness of
concrete there could be no hope of even partly recouping our
loss. Even Johnston seemed infected with our spirit; but
while we generally worked in dogged silence, he had ever
a jest on his lips.</p>
<p>One evening&mdash;and the days were shortening all too
rapidly&mdash;when I sat tired and dejected on an empty provision
case, a rail-layer brought in several letters, and,
as usual, they were all for me. Harry stood bare-armed,
with the dust still thick upon him, just outside the entrance
of the tent, holding a spider over our little stove, and
glanced half regretfully toward the budget. No one ever
seemed to write to Harry. The first was from Jasper. He
had visited Brandon and Winnipeg on business, and wrote
in his usual off-hand style.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in to see those dealers, taking my best broker
along, to convince them that we only raised solid men in this
section,&#8221; it ran. &#8220;Thought I&#8217;d enlighten them about you,
and the broker laid himself out to back me. He gets all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
my business&mdash;see?&mdash;while you can&#8217;t beat a Winnipeg
broker at real tall talking. I should say we impressed them
considerably; or perhaps it was the big cigars and the spread
at the hotel. Said they&#8217;d sense enough to know a straight
man when they saw him, and they&#8217;d give you plenty time
to pay in. So all you&#8217;ve got to do is to sail right on with
the track-grading. The boys were saying down to Elktail
that Fletcher and his father-in-law don&#8217;t get on, and there&#8217;s
going to be trouble there presently. I think the old man
started in to reform him, and Fletcher don&#8217;t like unlimited
reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like Jasper,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;A woman&#8217;s heart, and
the strength of three ordinary men. Still, when Jasper
starts in with a rush no man can say where he&#8217;ll finish, and
we may hear next that he has been all round Winnipeg
on our account borrowing money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the new partner, who was splitting firewood close
by, laid down his axe as he said: &#8220;Hope you&#8217;ll introduce me
to Jasper some day. From what you say, he is a man worth
knowing.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were two more letters, and the next&mdash;my fingers
trembled as I opened it&mdash;was from Grace. It was dated
from Starcross House, in Lancashire, and written in frank
friendliness, expressing regret for our misfortune, which, it
seemed, she had heard about, and ending: &#8220;But by this time
you will have learned that there are ups and downs in every
country, and I know you both have the courage to face
the latter. So go on with a stout heart, believing that I and
all your other friends look for your ultimate success.&#8221; To
this there was a postscript: &#8220;I met your cousin, Miss
Lorimer, the other day, and was sorry to find her very pale
and thin. She had just recovered from a serious illness, and
seemed troubled when I told her how you had lost your
harvest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>I placed the thin sheets reverently in an inside pocket,
and read them afterward over and over again, because I
might not answer them. She had written out of kindly
sympathy when the news of our trouble first reached her,
and that was all; while I felt I could not write a mere
formal note of thanks&mdash;and more than this was out of the
question now. Nevertheless, I was thankful for her good
wishes, and then I stood silent under the starlight, staring
down the misty coul√©e and thinking of Cousin Alice as
mechanically I stripped the envelope from the next letter.
She had always been ailing, even in the days when we
were almost as brother and sister; and now I longed that I
might comfort her as in my periodical fits of restlessness she
used to soothe me. That, however, was impossible, for my
cousin was part of the sheltered life I had left behind across
the sea, and I was in Western Canada with a very uncertain
future before me.</p>
<p>Then, moving back into the light of the lamp, I read
the last letter. With a gasp of astonishment, I handed it
to Harry, saying: &#8220;I can make nothing of this. Who in
the wide world can have sent the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laid down the spider, and, bending until the glow
from the tent door fell on the paper, read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mr. Ralph Lorimer, of Fairmead.</i></p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Sir</span>,&mdash;We have received the sum of one thousand
dollars, from a correspondent whose identity we are not at
liberty to reveal, to place to your credit. If you prefer,
you may regard this amount as an unsecured loan and repay
it with current interest on opportunity. Otherwise it is
unconditionally at your disposal, and we will have pleasure
in honoring your drafts to that extent.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Agent for the Bank of Montreal.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You are a lucky man,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;What will you
do with it?&#8221; And I answered with some hesitation:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know. Tell them to send it back,
most likely. We can both take care of ourselves without
depending on other people&#8217;s charity like remittance
men. And what right has any unknown person to send
money to me? My friends in England have apparently
cast me off utterly, and in no case would I accept a favor
from them. Still, I should like to discover who sent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some one who knows your little&mdash;we&#8217;ll say peculiarities,&#8221;
answered Harry dryly. &#8220;I sometimes wonder,
Ralph, what makes you so confoundedly proud of yourself.
Can&#8217;t you take it in the spirit it&#8217;s evidently meant, and be
thankful? You are not overburdened with worldly riches
at present, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this I made no answer. We needed money badly
enough&mdash;that at least was certain; and after our frugal
repast I marched up and down the line, thinking it over,
and then, chiefly for Harry&#8217;s sake, I decided to accept the
sum as a loan. It would materially help to lighten that
other crushing load of debt; and though growing more and
more puzzled, I felt, as Harry did, there was yet a great
kindness behind it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE UNEXPECTED</h3>
</div>

<p>On the first opportunity we paid off the most pressing
of our creditors, and continued our labor with greater
cheerfulness, working double tides when there was moonlight,
scooping out the line along the sides of the coul√©e,
though we lost more than I cared to calculate on every yard
of it. As we did so the days grew shorter and shorter,
and often in the mornings there was a keen frost in the air.
It was a losing game, but we had given our bond and
played it out stubbornly, while Johnston, who worked as
hard as either now, cheered us with witty anecdote and
quaint philosophy after each especially disappointing day.
Then one evening when the surveyor sat with us, as he
did occasionally, a man approached the tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a curious critter hunting round for you,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;looks most like a low-down played-out Britisher.
He&#8217;s wanting Contractor Lorimer, and won&#8217;t lie down until
he finds him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam Lee of Stoney Clough for a dollar; I&#8217;ve been
expecting him,&#8221; said Harry, with a low whistle. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t go, surveyor. Have you been fascinating any more
young damsels, Ralph? Larry, will you be kind enough
to show his reverence in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man grinned as he went out, and presently Lee
stood before us. He looked a little stronger than when I
last saw him, but there was trouble in his face, and, when
I explained to the rest who he was, he sat down and commenced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
his story. Life is generally hard to such as he, and
living close packed together in the hive of a swarming town,
with their few joys and many sorrows open for every eye
to see, they lose the grace of reticence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I set up a stitching shop in a shed against Tom
Fletcher&#8217;s house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There were none of my kin
left in the wide world but Minnie, and, if I wasn&#8217;t a burden,
I wanted to live near her. They brought me saddles and
harness to sew, and I earned a little, but I was main anxious
for Thomas Fletcher. The lust of strong drink was in him,
and he had sinful fits of temper, raging like one demented
when I told him to cast out the devil. &#8216;I&#8217;ll cast out thee
an&#8217; thy preaching into perdition,&#8217; he said. Then Minnie
must tell me if I was too good for her husband, and only
making trouble, they did not want me there, and I saw that
sometimes Tom Fletcher scowled with angry eyes at her
after I had spoken to him faithfully. So, because it is an ill
thing to cause strife between man and wife, I left my
daughter&mdash;and I had come half across the world to find
her. They told me there were lots of men and horses
working on the new railway, and I wondered if there was
anything I could do that would keep me. They said Ralph
Lorimer was a big contractor&mdash;an&#8217; there was doubt between
us, but I have forgiven thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very kind of you, I&#8217;m sure!&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;The
question is, however, what can you do?&#8221; and the old man
answered eagerly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything, if it&#8217;s saddles or harness or mending shoes.
I can cut things in hardwood and sharpen saws too, and
I&#8217;ll work for a trial for nothing but my keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked down at him compassionately, for he was old
and broken in spirit, and would plainly starve if turned
adrift on the prairie, while as I did so the surveyor broke
in:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You had better take him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, deciding that perhaps he could help us in some
small degree, and that we might spare a few dollars to give
him, even if he only kept us in whole shoes, I answered:
&#8220;Well, well see what you can do, and you can camp in
the other tent. There&#8217;s a set of worn-out harness for a
beginning to-morrow; and if you go right across you&#8217;ll
just be in time for supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thanked us with effusion, and when he went out
Harry said lightly: &#8220;We have made a very bad bargain, of
course, but I dare say we can manage to raise all he will cost
us. Naturally, I feel inclined to do something for the old
man, but that confounded Fletcher exasperates me. His
shadow has been over you ever since you started in this
country, and, I suppose it&#8217;s foolish, but I feel that some day
he&#8217;ll do you a greater injury. However, at present I almost
sympathize with his action. It isn&#8217;t cheerful to have a
future state of brimstone held up before one continually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I said you had better take him, I didn&#8217;t mean
at your own expense,&#8221; interposed the surveyor, &#8220;but that
in the circumstances it would come better so. I guess
we&#8217;ll squeeze him somehow on to the pay-roll of the Company.
Heard all about the whole thing from some one.
Who?&mdash;oh, General Jackson, how should I remember?
Kind of religio-political crank, isn&#8217;t he? Well, I&#8217;ve seen
some inventive geniuses among the species, and while we&#8217;re
driving straight ahead we can find use for a man if he&#8217;s
honest and handy finicking round the chores. Still, that
has nothing to do with what I&#8217;m coming to. We have
room for straight live men on this road, and I&#8217;ve been watching
you two. Guess you&#8217;ve been losing heavy, and you
stuck right down to it. Now, this branch is going to be
froze up presently, and they&#8217;ve sent for me to finish a mining
loop among the mountains of British Columbia; when some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
one else has fooled a tough job they generally do. They
listen at headquarters when I get up to talk, and the question
is, will you bring along your outfit and haul rocks and
lumber in the ranges for me? This time we&#8217;ll try to make
the deal a better one for you. We&#8217;ll square up and pay off
on what you&#8217;ve done so far; it will cut the loss, because
there&#8217;s more of the coul√©e, and there&#8217;ll be hard frost before
you&#8217;re out on the prairie. Now, I&#8217;ve been talking straight&mdash;what
have you to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked around at the others. Harry beamed approval,
Johnston nodded indifferently, and I felt a thrill of satisfaction
as I turned to the railroad autocrat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will come,&#8221; I said simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; was the laconic answer. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think
you&#8217;ll regret it,&#8221; and with a nod to each of us the man who
in a few moments had made a great change in our destiny
was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the up-grade now!&#8221; said Johnston, &#8220;but don&#8217;t lose
your heads. The great man paid you a tremendous compliment,
Ralph, and that kind of thing isn&#8217;t usual with him;
but take it coolly. More people get badly busted, as they
say in this benighted country, by sudden success than by
hard luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was good to lounge in the tent door that evening, and
remember that there would be no more dreary awakenings
to a day of profitless labor; but perhaps it was the cool
night wind and the frosty glitter of the stars that helped to
check the rush of hot, hopeful fancies through my brain.
I had learned already to distrust any untested offer of
prosperity.</p>
<p>For another week nothing of moment happened, and then
we spent an hour one morning with the surveyor and a
gray-haired gentleman from Winnipeg. He differed from
the former in many ways, and spoke with a deliberate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
urbanity, but I felt that he also spoke with authority and
was quietly taking stock of us. We signed several papers,
a receipt among them, and it was only then that I realized
what that unfortunate coul√©e had cost us, while, when at
last we went out, the surveyor said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have made a good impression, and that man&#8217;s
favorable opinion may mean great things to you. I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if you cashed a good many big pay drafts before
we have finished with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; I answered grimly. &#8220;At present we are
rather poorer than when we commenced the work, and
whomever the new railroad benefits it has done only harm to
us. That, however, is in no way your fault, and having
started we&#8217;re going on to see the end of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good man!&#8221; said the surveyor with a significant smile.
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be too previous. You have six days to
straighten up your business;&#8221; and after a brief conference
with Harry I departed for Fairmead and Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Our few cattle were thriving among the herds of our
neighbors, to whom we made over our stock of prairie
hay. The homestead would doubtless take care of itself
until we were ready to return there, as prairie homesteads
often have to do; while, whether it was owing to Jasper&#8217;s
eloquence or to other causes, I found our remaining creditors
both reasonable and willing to meet us as far as they could.
So I came back with a satisfactory report, and the same
evening we gathered those who worked for us about the
tent, and when we had handed each a roll of dollar bills
Harry laid the position before them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sunk all that was left in this contract,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and now when we are transferred to British Columbia
we set out almost empty-handed, with the wrong kind of
balance. It seems only fair I should tell you this frankly.
If you decide to come with us we will, if all goes well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
pay at present rates for the services of men and teams.
On the other hand, if there is any unforeseen difficulty we
may have nothing to pay with, and if any one wishes to go
back to his holding I should only say he&#8217;s sensible. We,
however, shall hold on as long as we have a dollar left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a toss-up,&#8221; added Johnston. &#8220;You take your
chances, and get what you can, facing the music pleasantly
like the rest of us if you get nothing, which seems quite
probable. Now don&#8217;t jump over the edge of a ravine like
the giddy antelope, but put your heads together and think
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a laugh from one of the men, who conferred
apart, and another said: &#8220;We&#8217;re coming along. There&#8217;s no
work for men or horses here in winter, and we&#8217;ve neither
money nor credit to sow in spring. Besides, we&#8217;ve taken
your money, you have treated us fairly, and it strikes us
as mean to back down on you now. So we&#8217;re open to
take the chances, and all we ask is that the chances should
figure either way. If you&#8217;re cleaned out, we get nothing;
if you win we want to come in. No; we&#8217;ve no use for a
sliding scale to fight each other on, and I guess we&#8217;ll take
Contractor Lorimer&#8217;s word he&#8217;ll do the square thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give it,&#8221; I said simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thank you;&#8221; and when they went away I felt the
weight of a double responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you on your leadership of the hard-up
company,&#8221; said Johnston lightly. &#8220;This is the kind of
thing that appeals to me&mdash;nothing to lose and all to win,
and determined men who can do anything with axe and
saw and horseflesh to back one. So it&#8217;s loose guy, up peg,
on saddle, and see what future waits us in the garden of the
Pacific slope&mdash;in mid-winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was seven days later, and many things had been done,
when with our working beasts and few other possessions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
lurching before us in a couple of cattle-cars, we went clattering
through the Rockies at the tail of a big freight train.
It was just breaking day, and Harry leaned beside me over
the platform rails of a car hooked on for our accommodation,
while Lee sat on the step close by wrapped in an old skin
coat Harry had given him. A shrill whistle came ringing
out of the stirred-up dust ahead, then the roar of wheels
grew louder, rolling back repeated and magnified from the
rocks above, while half-seen through the mist that rose
from a river spectral pines reeled by, and an icy blast
lashed my cheeks like a whip as, with throttle wide open
and the long cars bouncing behind, the great mountain
locomotive thundered down a declivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve&#8217;s letting her go,&#8221; said the surveyor, who came out
from the car. &#8220;Got to rush her through for the side-track
ahead of the west-bound mail. Say, the light is growing;
stay just where you are, for presently there&#8217;ll be unrolled
the most gorgeous panorama that ever delighted a sinful
mortal&#8217;s eye, and you&#8217;ll see the first of what some day is
going to be of all lands on this wide green earth the greatest
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked up, and already the mist was rolling back like
a curtain from the great slopes of rock above, sliding in
smoky wreaths across the climbing pines, while as the
brightness increased we could see the torrent, whose voice
now almost drowned the clash of couplings and the clamor
of wheels, frothing green and white-streaked among mighty
boulders in the gorge below. Then as we swung giddily
over a gossamer-like timber bridge, the walls of quartz
and blue grit fell back on either hand; and, for the first
time, I gazed in rapt silence upon the cold unsullied whiteness
of eternal snow, undefiled from the beginning by any
foot of man. It stretched in a glimmering saw-edge high
above us athwart the brightening east, and, below, smooth-scarped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
slopes of rock polished to a steely luster by endless
ages of grinding ice, slid down two, or it may have been
four, thousand feet, to the stately pines on the hillsides below.</p>
<p>There were peaks like castles, spires like the fretted
stonework of Indian minarets, wrought by the hand of
nature out of an awful cold purity, and mountains which
resembled nothing I had ever seen or dreamed of, banded
white with broken edges of green by winding glaciers;
while sombered forests, every trunk in which the surveyor
said exceeded two hundred feet in height, were wrapped
about their knees. It was a scene of plutonic grandeur,
weirdly impressive under the first of the light, with a stamp
upon it of unearthly glory, and we drew in our breath
when a great peak behind us glowed for a moment rosy
red and then faded into saffron, just before a long shaft
of radiance turned the whiteness on its shoulders into
incandescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that, Lee?&#8221; Harry asked.</p>
<p>The old man, staring about him with a great wonder in
his eyes, answered, with half-coherent solemnity: &#8220;It&#8217;s the
Almighty&#8217;s handiwork made manifest;&#8221; and as we swept
across a trestle and the trembling timber flung back the
vibratory din, I caught the disjointed phrases, &#8220;The framing
of the everlastin&#8217; hills; a sign an&#8217; a token while the earth
shall last&mdash;an&#8217; there are many who will not see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said the surveyor, smiling across at me.
&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m a mechanic, and look at it in a practical way.
To me it&#8217;s a tremendous display of power, which is irresistible,
even though it works mighty slowly. Sun, wind,
and frost, all doing their share in rubbing out broad valleys
and wearing down the hills, and, with the d√©bris, the rivers
are spreading new lands for wheat and fruit west into the
sea. &#8216;Wild nature run riot, chaotic desolation!&#8217; it says
in the guide. No, sir; this is a great scheme, and I guess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
there&#8217;s neither waste nor riot. Well, that is not our business;
it&#8217;s our part to make a way to take out ore and
produce, and bring in men&mdash;this is going to be an almighty
great country. Timber for half the world, gold and silver,
iron, lead, coal, and copper, rivers to give you power for
nothing wherever you like to tap one with a dynamo, and a
coast that&#8217;s punctuated with ready-made harbors! All we
want is men and railroads, and we mean to get them. I
figure that if sometime our children&mdash;I&#8217;m thankful I&#8217;ve
got none&mdash;move the greatest Empire&#8217;s center West, they&#8217;ll
leave Montreal and Ottawa rusting, and locate it here between
the Rockies and the sea. But I guess I&#8217;m talking
nonsense, and there&#8217;s a little in the flask&mdash;here&#8217;s to the
New Westminster, and blank all annexationists!&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry nodded as he passed the flask on to me, while Lee
groaned deprecatingly, and then, brushing the gray hair
back from his forehead with thin crooked fingers, said:
&#8220;An&#8217; by then there&#8217;ll be no more cold homes and hunger
for the poor in England. It&#8217;s coming, the time we&#8217;ve been
waiting, starving, and some of us praying for so long, an&#8217;
if they get their own by law, or take it tramplin&#8217; through
the blood of the oppressor, they&#8217;ll live and speak free
Englishmen, spread out on all the good lands the Almighty
intended for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not answer, though Harry said aside that he did
not know the whole earth was made for Englishmen. There
was occasionally much in what Lee said that commanded
sympathy, but he had a habit of relapsing into vague
prophetic utterance, which was perhaps acquired when he
ran the Stoney Clough chapel. Still, as hour by hour we
went clattering through solemn forests almost untouched by
the axe, or rending apart the silence that hung over great
lonely lakes, and past wide rivers, while the whole air
was filled with the fragrance of pines and cedars, I wondered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
whether either his or the surveyor&#8217;s forecast would
come true, and decided if that were so England would have
cause to be proud of this rich country. For the rest, Harry
and I never found our interest slacken, and looked on in
silence as that most gorgeous panorama of snow-peak, forest,
and glacier unwound itself league after league before us,
until at last amid a grinding of brakes the long freight
train ran onto a side track. She was only just in time,
for with the ballast trembling beneath, and red cinders
flying from the funnel of the mammoth mountain engine
ahead, the Atlantic mail went by. Then, as we stepped
down on the track the same thought was evidently uppermost
in each of us, for Harry said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, this land approaches one&#8217;s wildest fancies of a
terrestrial paradise, and if in spite of our efforts we fail at
Fairmead it&#8217;s comforting to think we can always bring up
here. If I had the choice I&#8217;d like to be buried in the heart
of those forests. What do you say, Johnston?&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnston smiled a little, but his tone was not the usual
one as he answered: &#8220;I think I shall. You&#8217;ll say it sounds
like old woman&#8217;s talk, but I fancy I&#8217;ll never recross those
Rockies. Anyway, it won&#8217;t worry the rest of humanity
very much if I don&#8217;t, and I dare say we&#8217;ll get some small
excitement track-grading in the meantime. This country
doesn&#8217;t lay itself out to favor railroad building, especially
in winter.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>ADVOCATES OF TEMPERANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a month later, and we had settled down to our
new task, when Lee, who had managed to make himself
generally useful, took a wholly unexpected step. Our camp
stood beside the partly completed track, which after climbing
through the passes wound along the edge of a precipice into
a bowl-shaped hollow among the mountains. High above
it on the one hand the hillsides sloped up toward the snow,
which now crept lower to meet them every day. It was
strewn with massy boulders and bare outcrops of rock, while
the pines which managed to find a foothold here and there
glittered with frost crystals every morning. Below, a wide
blue lake filled half the hollow, and shingled roofs peeped
out among the cedars that spread their rigid branches over
its placid waters, while the roar of a frothing torrent rose
hoarsely from the forest behind. Beyond this, and walled
off by stupendous mountains from the outer world, lay an
auriferous region, and a wooden town whose inhabitants
had long struggled for an existence, hampered by the cost of
bringing in stores and machinery by pack-horse train.</p>
<p>Railroad-building in such a land is an arduous task,
needing a bold conception and a reckless execution, while
no line is ever driven that is not partly paid for with the
adventurous legion&#8217;s blood. Our share, however, was one of
the safest, for it consisted in hewing logs out of the forest
for framing the spidery trestles and snow-sheds, hauling
sawn lumber into position, and doing general teamster&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
work. Risks there were of course&mdash;the rush of a charging
boulder, or a sudden descent of shale, while occasionally a
partly grubbed out trunk came thundering down before it
was expected to. Comparatively few trained mechanics
could be found among all the men about us, and, as usual,
the hardest part of the struggle devolved upon the reckless
free-lances&mdash;sailor-men deserters, unfortunate prospectors,
forest ranchers whose possessions were mortgaged to the hilt,
and others of the kind, who are always to the front when
at the risk of life and limb a new way for civilization is
hewn through the forests of the Pacific Slope.</p>
<p>One morning, when I rested my team a few moments,
talking to Harry and the surveyor after hauling a heavy log,
Johnston came up chuckling, with a strip of cedar bark on
which a notice was written.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an ardent reformer among our ranks, and,
everything considered, I admire his pluck,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
notice you&#8217;re all invited if you listen to this&mdash;&#8216;A temperance
meeting will be held outside the Magnolia saloon to-night,
when Fanny Marvin and Adam Lee will turn the
flash-light upon the evils of drink and gamblin&#8217;. Every
sensible man is requested to step along.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought there was something brewing,&#8221; said Harry.
&#8220;Lee has lately foregathered with certain sober-faced individuals
from Ontario, and they&#8217;ve been plotting mysteriously.
Well, I suppose there will be trouble over it; but who is
this Marvin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a rising religious reformer who has taken several
towns on Puget Sound by storm,&#8221; said the surveyor, &#8220;and it
has cost somebody considerable to bring her here. That
<i>prot√©g√©</i> of yours is clearly a crank, but he&#8217;s also more of a
man than he looks, and, if it can be done unofficially, I&#8217;m
inclined to back him. No, I&#8217;m not a teetotaler, and as a rule
we&#8217;re a sober people in Western Canada, but they&#8217;re a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
tolerably hard crowd down at Cedar, and if once the man
who runs the Magnolia takes hold with his tables we&#8217;ll have
chaos in this camp. I&#8217;m not prejudiced, but if they must
have excitement I&#8217;d sooner see the boys whooping round a
temperance meeting than a gaming bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going, Ralph?&#8221; asked Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
altogether fond of the man, but in a measure we are
responsible for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not answer at first as I looked down upon the roofs
of Cedar Crossing. The old trail, which would be useless
presently, came winding down through the passes into it, and
I knew that while the average British Columbian is a sturdy
law-abiding citizen, a love of excitement characterizes the
miner, and after being driven out of the central town site
by an energetic reform committee, a few adventurers of
both sexes and indifferent morals had foregathered at Cedar
Crossing, with the Magnolia saloon as headquarters.</p>
<p>Then I said, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going&#8221;; and, as he departed,
the surveyor observed dryly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take along a few picked men with axes. They might
come in handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bright starlight shone coldly on the dim white peaks
when Harry and I stumbled among the boulders by Cedar
Lake, in whose clear depths it lay reflected with a silvery
glitter. But it was warm down in the valley, and the
drowsy breath of cedars filled the air, until a reek of kerosene
replaced it, and presently a ruddy glare broke out
among the giant trunks. When we halted under the blinking
torches and two petroleum cressets outside the Magnolia,
it seemed as if all the staff of the railroad had gathered
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re both here,&#8221; said Harry, and I saw Lee standing
beside a slender figure in unbecoming dress among a
group of men in blue shirts and quaintly mended jackets;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
also that some planks had been laid across two barrels
close by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t crowd upon the lady!&#8221; said a voice. &#8220;Order!
the circus is going to begin; we&#8217;re only waiting for the
chairman. What&#8217;s that? Ain&#8217;t got no such luxuries; well,
he can take the barrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this, to our astonishment, Johnston, neatly attired,
stood aloft upon an overturned barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see so many of you, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now
I&#8217;m not a teetotaler myself, and this is the first time I&#8217;ve
occupied such a platform; but we&#8217;re all open to conviction,
and I want you to remember we&#8217;ve a lady here who has
traveled three hundred miles to talk to you. All we ask is
that you will give her and the old man a fair show.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had struck the right note, for the British Columbian
is a somewhat chivalrous person, and there was silence,
through which the jingle of a piano in the saloon broke
irritatingly, until Lee stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a sinful man like the rest of you,&#8221; he began in
the more formal English and high-pitched inflection I knew
so well, though the effect was diminished because some one
broke in with assumed wonder, &#8220;You don&#8217;t say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve the same passions in me,&#8221; continued the orator,
unheeding, &#8220;and once I came near murder, while for six
long years I was a sodden slave to this awful drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only awful when it&#8217;s bad!&#8221; another voice said; and
there was a cry, &#8220;He&#8217;s getting ahead nicely! &#8217;Rah for the
next President! Give him a show!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sodden mind and body!&#8221; repeated Lee; &#8220;a-groveling
on hands and knees in the pit of iniquity, and when I came
out it left me what you see&mdash;a broken man who, if he&#8217;d
saved his soul, was too late to save his body. That&#8217;s what
you&#8217;ll remember&mdash;no one can wallow without paying for it,
and you&#8217;re strong men who were meant for better. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
all in the choice you make&mdash;health, happiness, prosperity&mdash;a
jump down a precipice into eternity, or dying half-rotten
in a Vancouver hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old thing, but he&#8217;s taking hold,&#8221; said Harry when
the speaker paused a moment, and then a glow of light
beat out while a tall figure stood in the doorway of the
saloon. The man&#8217;s face was scornful beneath the costly
wide-brimmed hat; he wore a spotless white shirt instead of
a blue one, while&mdash;and this was an unusual sight&mdash;a heavy
revolver was strapped about his waist, and neatly polished
boots reached to his knees. This I knew was Hemlock
Jim, of evil repute, who had set up a gaming table, and was
supposed to have purchased an interest in the Magnolia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in, boys, instead of fooling &#8217;round
outside there in the cold?&#8221; he asked derisively. &#8220;You can
have as much water as you like, and we won&#8217;t charge you
nothin&#8217; for the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wondered what Johnston, who conferred with his companions,
would do.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we will,&#8221; said the chairman. &#8220;Much obliged to
you. File in quietly, boys, and those who can&#8217;t find room
will sit on the veranda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry chuckled. &#8220;This is distinctly a new line for our
partner,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;and the whole trio have pluck
enough. I fancy if the other side try any tricks they&#8217;ll find
their match in Johnston.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, amid banter and laughter, the big bronzed men
filed up the long bare room, after which all eyes were
turned toward the three who sat on a little platform beside a
piano. Facing them another group, who I fancied meant
mischief, lounged against the bar, looking on sardonically.
Then the proprietor, who wore a large diamond in his
white shirt-front, came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;This yere discussin&#8217; temperance is thirsty work,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
&#8220;and it might improve the general harmony if before you
begin in earnest you had a drink with me. Ask them what
they&#8217;re shouting for, Jim; and, Jess, for once you&#8217;ll rustle
round with the tray.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a jingle of glasses, and a damsel with very
pink cheeks and lemon-colored hair, who apparently presided
over the piano, went round with a tray. It was
emptied several times, and I began to foresee that the
temperance demonstration would fail miserably, as it might
have done but for Johnston&#8217;s ready wit and the opposite
party&#8217;s imprudence. Grinning derisively, Hemlock Jim led
the waitress straight up to the orators&#8217; platform, and, with
the revolver showing significantly as he bent forward, he
held out the tray saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;It will help the good feelin&#8217; if you have a drink with
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a false step. A big man from the bush of
Ontario, whose forebears had probably been Scottish Covenanters,
stretched his long limbs out in front of Hemlock,
while Johnston smiled as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at present. Unfortunately I&#8217;m a little particular
as to whom I drink with. Boys, don&#8217;t you think it would
be fairer if you heard our guests first, and then paid for
your own refreshment afterward if they didn&#8217;t convince
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hemlock Jim deliberately set down his tray, the Ontario
bushman seemed gathering himself together for some purpose,
and there was an ominous glitter in Johnston&#8217;s eyes,
while just as I expected the fray to begin, the proprietor
called out laughingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit right down, Jim. Pass on them glasses, Jess. I
guess they won&#8217;t refuse you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was diplomatic, but Johnston&#8217;s hint of fairness went
further, and in spite of the frail beauty&#8217;s smiles, a number
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
of those who listened waved the tray aside with the words
&#8220;I pass!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, when some one called out to ask what was the
matter with the circus, and whether the clown were lost,
while others demanded &#8220;The lady!&#8221; Johnston turned to
Miss Marvin, and there was a hush as the slight girlish
figure&mdash;and she seemed very young&mdash;stood upright before
us. She thrust back the unlovely bonnet, and her thin
face was flushed; but when, clenching nervous fingers upon
the dowdy gown, she raised a high clear voice, every man
in the assembly settled himself to listen. Perhaps it was
a chivalrous respect for her womanhood, or mere admiration
for personal courage, and she had most gallantly taken
up the challenge; but I think she also spoke with force
and sincerity, for my own pulse quickened in time to the
rapid utterance. Then changing from the somewhat conventional
tirade, she leaned forward speaking very gently,
and one could hear the men breathe in the stillness, while,
as far as I can remember, the plain words ran:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not only for you I&#8217;m pleading; there are the
women, too&mdash;the sweethearts, wives and daughters waiting
at home for you. Just where and how are they waiting?
Shall I tell you? &#8217;Way back up yonder tending the cattle
in the lonely ranch, where the timber wolves howl along
ranges on the moonlight nights; and I guess you know it&#8217;s
lonely up there in the bush. Then I can see others sewing
with heavy eyes and backs that are aching in a Vancouver
shack. You had no money to leave them, and they had to
do the best they could. Have they no use for the money
you would spend in liquor here&mdash;the women who never
cried out when they let you go? Don&#8217;t heart-break and
black, black solitude count anything with you? You&#8217;re
building railroads, building up a great Dominion, but the
waiting women are doing their part, too. And I&#8217;m thinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
of others still, gilt-edged and dainty, &#8217;way in the old country.
I&#8217;ve seen a few. Where&#8217;s the man from an English college
that used to feel himself better after they talked to him?
Is he here with the fire of bad whisky in him, betting
against the banker to win a smile from Jess of Caribou?&#8221;</p>
<p>This woman knew how to stir them, and there was an
expressive murmur, while some fidgeted. Then the proprietor
beckoned across the room, and Hemlock Jim spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is only high-tone sentiment. Most of us aren&#8217;t
married, and don&#8217;t intend to. No, sir, we&#8217;ve no use for
a missis rustling round with a long-handled broom on the
track of us, and I&#8217;m going to move an amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Johnston. &#8220;You brought us
in of your own will, and now you&#8217;ve got to hear us.
This meeting is going on quietly to its conclusion if I hold
the chair. Sit down, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be shot if I do!&#8221; said the other, and it became
evident that trouble was near, for a group of the disaffected
commenced to sidle toward the platform, calling on Caribou
Jessy to give them a song.</p>
<p>But Johnston was equal to the occasion. &#8220;If you&#8217;re
wanting music we&#8217;ve brought our own orchestra along.
Mr. Harry Lorraine, the tenor, will oblige you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry promptly entered into the spirit of the thing, for
he sat down good-humoredly, and, though I forget what
he sang, it was a ballad with a catching refrain, which he
rendered well, and hardly had the applause died away when
the girl commenced again, while Lee, who followed, made a
strong impression this time. Then, before the interest had
slackened, Miss Marvin held up a little book, smiling
sweetly as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of you to listen so patiently, and now I&#8217;m
asking a last favor. Won&#8217;t you all walk along and write
your names down here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>A number of the listeners did so, and when the rest
refused jestingly, Johnston got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The meeting is over,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but there&#8217;s one thing
yet to do&mdash;to pass a vote of thanks to the proprietor for
the use of his saloon. Then I should like to ask him to
lay out his best cigars on the bar for every one to help
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was acclamation, and the assembly would have
dispersed peaceably but that just as we went out Hemlock
Jim, who had gathered the disaffected round him, said to
Johnston:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see the last of you. Now sail out into
perdition, and take your shameless woman with you. But&mdash;I&#8217;m
not particular&mdash;she&#8217;s got to pay tribute first.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grasped the trembling girl&#8217;s shoulder, dragged back
the ample bonnet, but the next moment I had him by the
throat, and he went reeling sideways among his comrades.
Then, as by a signal the tumult began, for with a crash
of splintered glass the nearest lamp went out, and a rush
was made upon us. Something struck me heavily on the
head; I saw Johnston stagger under a heavy blow; but I
held myself before the girl as we were hustled through the
doorway, and when a pistol-barrel glinted one of the railroad
men whirled aloft an axe. We were outside now, but the
pistol blazed before the blade came down, and a man beside
me caught at a veranda pillar with a cry just as the door
banged to.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Pete of the shovel gang!&#8221; somebody said. &#8220;It was
Hemlock Jim who shot him. Where&#8217;s the man with the
axe to chop one of these pillars for a battering-ram? Roll
round here, railroad builders!&#8221;</p>
<p>A roar of angry voices broke out, and it was evident that
popular sympathy was on the reformers&#8217; side, while my blood
was up. Pete of the shovel gang, a quiet, inoffensive man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
sat limply on the veranda, with the blood trickling from his
shoulder, and there was the insult to the girl to be avenged;
while, if more were needed, somebody hurled opprobrious
epithets at us from an upper window. I wrenched the axe
from its owner&mdash;and he resisted stubbornly&mdash;whirled it
round my shoulder, and there was another roar when after
a shower of splinters the stout post yielded. It was torn
loose from the rafters, swung backward by sinewy arms,
and driven crashing against the saloon door, one panel of
which went in before it. Twice again, while another pistol-shot
rang out, we plied the ram, and then followed it pell-mell
across the threshold, where we went down in a heap
amid the wreckage of the door, though I had sense enough
left to remove Hemlock&#8217;s smoking revolver which lay close
by, just where he had dropped it on the floor. He evidently
had not expected this kind of attack and suffered for his
ignorance. We could not see him, but a breathless voice implored
somebody to &#8220;Give them blame deadbeats socks!&#8221;
and there was evidently need for prompt action, because the
rest of our opponents had entrenched themselves behind the
bar, which was freely strengthened by chairs and tables;
also, as we picked ourselves up, an invisible man behind the
barricade called out in warning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop right there. Two of us have guns!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come out, and give up Hemlock Jim?&#8221; asked
Johnston, while half a dozen men who had found strangely
assorted weapons gathered alert and eager behind him, a
little in advance of the rest, and Lee panted among them
with the blood running down his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want him you&#8217;ve got to lick us first!&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;We don&#8217;t back down on a partner. But I guess
he&#8217;s hardly worth the trouble, for he&#8217;s looking very sick&mdash;your
blank battering-ram took him in the stummick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One minute in which to change your mind!&#8221; said Johnston,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
holding up his watch. &#8220;Bring along that log, boys,
and get her on the swing;&#8221; and tightening my grip on the
axe I watched the heavy beam oscillate as our partner
called off the last few seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty-four! fifty-five! fifty-six!&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But he got no further. Swinging sideways from the
waist, he was only just in time, for once more a pistol flashed
among the chairs; and when another man loosed his hold
Johnston roared, &#8220;Let her go!&#8221;</p>
<p>The head of the beam went forward; we followed it with
a yell. There was a crash of splintered redwood, and my
axe clove a chair. Then shouting men were scrambling over
the remnants of the bar, while just what happened during
the next few moments I do not remember, except that there
was a great destruction of property, and presently I halted
breathless, while the leader of the vanquished, who were
hemmed in a corner, raised his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re corralled, and give up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Hemlock
Jim&mdash;not much good to any one by the look of him.
What are you going to do with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are those men badly hurt?&#8221; asked Johnston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; some one answered. &#8220;Pete&#8217;s drilled clean
through the upper arm; it missed the artery, and the ball
just ripped my leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll settle about Jim afterward; it&#8217;s surgical
assistance he wants first. As to the rest of you, he led you
into this, and we&#8217;ll let you go on two conditions&mdash;you subscribe
a dollar each to Miss Marvin&#8217;s society and sign the
pledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a burst of laughter, in which even some of
the vanquished joined sheepishly; but as they filed past between
a guard armed with shovels and empty bottles Johnston
saw that they filled their names into the book, and duly
handed each his ticket, while I regret to say that Harry&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
selection was daringly appropriate, as with full musical
honors he played them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a hat at the door!&#8221; said Johnston, &#8220;you can
put your dollars in. You have spent an exciting evening,
and must pay for your fun.&#8221; And presently that hat overflowed
with money, while Lee, with his Ontario stalwarts,
did huge execution with a shovel among such bottles as
remained unwrecked behind the bar. We placed Hemlock
Jim on a stretcher, groaning distressfully, while our two
wounded declared themselves fit to walk, and before we
marched off in triumph to the camp Johnston raised his
hat as he placed a heavy package of silver in Miss Marvin&#8217;s
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt your organization can make a good use
of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also a tribute to your own bravery.
I&#8217;ll leave you half a dozen men who&#8217;ll camp in the road
opposite your lodgings, and see you safely back to the main
line to-morrow. They&#8217;re most sober Calvinists, with convictions
of the Cromwellian kind, and I don&#8217;t think any of
our late disturbers will care to interfere with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we approached the tents, chanting weird songs of
victory, the surveyor met us, and in answer to his questions
Johnston laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The temperance meeting was an unqualified success,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve broken up all the bottles in the Magnolia saloon&mdash;Lee
reveled among them with a hammer. Then we
made all the malcontents we could catch sign the pledge, and
you&#8217;ll find the chief dissenter behind there on the stretcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear it,&#8221; remarked the surveyor, dryly. &#8220;Judging
by your appearance the proceedings must have been of
the nature of an Irish fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember that when we discussed the affair later Johnston
said, &#8220;What did I do it for? Well, perhaps from a
sense of fairness, or because that girl&#8217;s courage got hold of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
me. Don&#8217;t set up as a reformer&mdash;that&#8217;s not me; but I&#8217;ve
a weakness for downright if blundering sincerity, and I
fancied I could indirectly help them a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning we were astonished to find that Hemlock
Jim had gone. &#8220;Thought he was dyin&#8217; last night!&#8221;
said the watcher, &#8220;and as that didn&#8217;t matter I went to sleep;
woke up, and there wasn&#8217;t a trace of him.&#8221; This was evidently
true, and where he went to remained a mystery, for
we heard no more of Hemlock Jim, though there was a
marked improvement in the morals of Cedar Crossing, while,
and this we hardly expected, some of those who signed that
pledge honestly kept it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE HIRED TEAMSTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Speaking generally, winter is much less severe in British
Columbia, especially near the coast, than it is on the
prairie, though it is sufficiently trying high up among the
mountains, where as a rule little work is done at that season.
Still, though the number of the track-layers was largely
reduced, the inhabitants of the mining region had waited
long enough, and so, in spite of many hardships, slowly,
fathom by fathom, we carried the rail-head on.</p>
<p>Now and then for several days together we sat in our
log-built shelter while a blinding snowstorm raged outside
and the pines filled the valley with their roaring. Then
there were weeks of bitter frost, when work was partly
suspended, and both rock and soil defied our efforts. One
of our best horses died and another fell over a precipice.
Hay was hardly to be bought with money, provisions only
at an exorbitant cost, and though we received a few interim
payments it was, as Johnston said, even chances either way
if we kept on top, because every day of enforced idleness
cost us many dollars. However, floundering through snow-slush,
swinging the axe in driving sleet and rain, or hauling
the mossy logs through the mire of a sudden thaw, we persisted
in our task, though often at nights we sat inside the
shanty, which was filled with steaming garments, counting
the cost, in a state of gloomy despondency. Except for the
thought of Grace, there were moments when I might have
yielded; but we were always an obstinate race, and seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
that I was steadfastly determined to hold out to the last,
the others gallantly aided me. Now, when the time of
stress is past, I know how much I owe to their loyalty.</p>
<p>At length, however, the winter drew to an end, and the
whole mountain region rejoiced at the coming of the spring.
A warm wind from the Pacific set the cedars rustling, the
sun shone bright and hot, and the open fringe of the forest
was garlanded with flowers, while a torrent made wild music
in every ravine. I was sitting outside our shanty one morning
smoking a pet English briar, whose stem was bitten
half-way, and reveling in the warmth and brightness, when
the unexpected happened. By degrees, perhaps under the
spell of some influence which stirs us when sleeping nature
awakens once more to life, I lost myself in reverie, and
recalled drowsily a certain deep, oak-shrouded hollow under
the Lancashire hills, where at that season pale yellow stars of
primroses peeped out among the fresh green of tender leaves.
Then the bald heights of Starcross Moor rose up before
me, and Grace came lightly across the heather chanting a
song, with her hat flung back, and the west wind kissing her
face into delicate color, until a tramp of footsteps drew
nearer down the track.</p>
<p>A man, who evidently was neither a bush-rancher nor a
railroad hand, approached and said with a pure English
accent:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a difficulty, and it was suggested that Contractor
Lorimer might help me. I presume I have the pleasure of
addressing him? My name is Calvert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will if I can,&#8221; I answered, and the stranger continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my duty to escort two ladies from the main line
into the Lonsdale valley. They have a quantity of baggage,
and I have no confidence in the half-starved Cayuse ponies
the Indians offered me. The trails are hardly safe just now,
and the regular freighters hadn&#8217;t a beast to spare. It would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
be a favor if you came with yours, and we should, of course,
be glad to recoup you for the time you lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>His manner was pleasant, money was very scarce then,
and as it happened we had been compelled to lay off for a
day or two, awaiting material; so I arranged to start with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little change will be good for you,&#8221; Harry said, when
the man departed. &#8220;You have been looking as grim as a
hungry bear lately. Jim Lawrence, I dare say, would lend
you his sisters&#8217; saddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outward journey, made partly under cover of darkness,
was arduous, for each torrent came roaring down
swollen by melting snow almost bank-full, and portions of
the trail had been washed away; but we reached the station
settlement in safety, and after a few hours&#8217; sleep there we
turned out to meet the west-bound train. It came thundering
down the valley presently with the sunlight flashing
upon burnished metal and the long car windows, and when
amid a roar of blown-off steam it rolled into the station, I
wondered with mild curiosity what kind of women the new
arrivals would be. The next moment my pulse quickened
as a gray-haired lady stepped down from the platform of
a car, for when my companion hurried forward with uplifted
hat I saw that it was Miss Carrington, while fresh
and dainty, as though she had not traveled at all, Grace
followed her.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that my place was that of hired
teamster, and I stood waiting outside the baggage-car until
Calvert gave me the brass checks, after which I assisted the
man who came with me to cinch a surprisingly heavy load
on our two pack-horses. The battered felt hat probably
concealed my face, all I had on was homely and considerably
the worse for wear, and it was scarcely surprising that
they did not recognize me. Presently, leading Jasper&#8217;s bay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
horse forward, I stooped and held out my hand for Grace to
rest her little foot on, and when she swung herself lightly
into the saddle, Calvert said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner we start the better, the trails are positively
awful. Contractor Lorimer, you will no doubt take especial
care of Miss Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swinging low the broad hat, I looked up and saw a faint
tinge of crimson mantle in the face of the girl, while again
a thrill went through me when she said simply, &#8220;Ralph!&#8221;
for that name had never passed her lips before in my
hearing.</p>
<p>Then, while Calvert looked hard at me and the elder
lady bowed, she patted the bay horse&#8217;s neck, saying frankly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an unexpected pleasure, and I have often been thinking
about you, but never expected to meet you here. What
a handsome beast you have brought me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace seldom showed all her feelings, for a sweet serenity
characterized her, but this time I fancied that our relative
positions both puzzled and troubled her, and I regretted my
own stupidity in not asking who the ladies were. Still, I
managed to answer that C√¶sar should be proud of his burden.</p>
<p>That was a memorable journey in various ways. In
places, beaten by the hoofs of many pack-horses, the trail
was knee-deep in mire, and in others it was lost under beds
of treacherous shale. But C√¶sar was used to the mountains,
and I strode beside his head, heeding neither slippery
shingle nor plastic mud, for Grace chatted about her English
visit, and with such a companion I should have floundered
contentedly over leagues of ice and snow.</p>
<p>The valleys were filled with freshness, and the air was
balmy with scents, while every bird and beast rejoiced with
the vigor of the spring. Now and then a blue grouse broke
out drumming from the summit of a stately fir, white-headed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
eagles and fish-hawks wheeled screaming above the frothing
shallows on slanted wing, and silently, like flitting shadows,
the little wood-deer leaped across the trail, or amid a
crash of undergrowth a startled black bear charged in blind
panic through the dim recesses of the bush. Once, too,
with a snarl, a panther sprang out from a thicket, and Calvert&#8217;s
rifle flashed; but the only result was that C√¶sar tried
to rear upright. With fear I clutched at his rein, and it
was a pretty sight to see the big, rough-coated horse settle
down as if ashamed of his fright when the fair rider spoke
soothingly to him. All dumb creatures took kindly to
Grace, and, though C√¶sar could show a very pretty temper
in ungentle hands, he yielded to the caressing touch of her
soft fingers. Then he turned his eyes upon me with a look
that seemed an apology for dividing his allegiance, while
Grace smiled under lowered lashes, as though she did not
wish to meet my gaze. It was a trifling incident, but inwardly
I thanked the good horse for it. Later, when we
came up out of a roaring ford, through which I carefully
led C√¶sar, with the stream boiling about my waist, into a
dim avenue, she looked down at me as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a dream-like country, and I never imagined anything
so beautiful. And yet it is familiar. Do you remember
what you once said to me at Lone Hollow?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was wholly unnecessary, for I could remember
each moment of that night, and any one in touch
with nature could understand her comment. It was a great
forest temple through which we were marching, where the
giant conifers were solemn with the antiquity of long ages,
for it had taken probably a thousand years to raise the
vaulted roof above us, with its groined arches of red branches
and its mighty pillars of living wood. Nature does all
things slowly, but her handiwork is very good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Grace continued, &#8220;it seems familiar&mdash;as though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
you and I had ridden together through such a country once
before; I even seem to know those great redwoods well.
I&mdash;I think I dreamed it, but there is another intangible
memory in which you figured too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not be in better company,&#8221; I answered, smiling,
though my heart beat. &#8220;We are such stuff as dreams are
made of, and our little life is rounded with a sleep, you
know; and here among the mountains it seems borne in on
one forcibly that, as I told you my partner said, man&#8217;s intellect
is feeble and we do not know everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace sighed, and then, though she answered lightly,
there was the same puzzled look on her face that I had
seen for a moment at Cypress Hollow. It seemed as if her
mind reached forward toward something that eluded its
grasp, until we both broke into laughter as a willow-grouse
disturbed by the horse&#8217;s feet rose whirring to a redwood
branch and perched there, close within reach, regarding us
with an assurance that was ludicrous.</p>
<p>&#8220;It thinks it is perfectly safe,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You might
shoot until you hit it, or knock it down with a stick, and yet
there is no more timorous creature among the undergrowth,
unless it has a brood of chicks, when it will attack any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>At noon we rested for luncheon in an open glade, where
bright sunlight beat down upon the boulders of a stream
which surged among them, stained green by the drainage
from a glacier; and there was merry laughter over the viands
Calvert produced from his pack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did my best, Miss Carrington,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but as yet
they&#8217;re a primitive people among these mountains&mdash;and it&#8217;s
not to be wondered at, with that huge rampart between
them and civilization. &#8216;Something nice for a lady?&#8217; the
storekeeper said. &#8216;Guess I&#8217;ve just got it.&#8217; And he planked
down a salmon-fed reistit ham and this bottle of ancient
candy, with the dead flies thrown in. Still, one can&#8217;t help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
admiring them for the way they&#8217;ve held on, growing stuff
they cannot sell, building stores where few men come to buy,
and piling up low-grade ore that won&#8217;t pay its pack-freight
to the smelter. Also I&#8217;ve seen work that three men spent
a year over which a hydraulic monitor would have done in a
few days, while the rocks seem bursting with riches and the
valleys with fertility; but they can get neither produce out
nor mining plant in. Their greatest hero now is a certain
enterprising director, and they&#8217;d decline an angel&#8217;s visit at
any time for that of a railroad builder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sometimes wish I had been born a man, with work
of that kind to do,&#8221; said Grace, with a fire in her eyes.
&#8220;We hear of the old romance and lost chivalry, but there
was never more than in these modern days, only it has
changed its guise. If we haven&#8217;t the knight in armor or the
roystering swashbuckler, we have the man with the axe and
drill; and is it not a task for heroes to drive the level steel
road through these tremendous mountains? You are smiling,
Mr. Calvert. I read the papers&mdash;Colonial and British,
all I can come across&mdash;and I know that some day
England will need all her colonies. You cannot deny that
this is a sensible question: Which is the better for an English
gentleman, to use all the strength and valor that is entrusted
him&mdash;we are taught there will be a reckoning when
he must account for them&mdash;subduing savage Nature, that
the hungry may eat cheaper bread, or lounging about a racecourse,
shooting driven pheasants&mdash;I know it needs high
skill&mdash;or wasting precious hours in the reeking smoke-room
of his club? If I had a brother I should sooner see him
working as a C.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;track-shoveler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace has strong opinions,&#8221; said the old lady. &#8220;I
think she is right, in a measure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calvert bowed. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the Carrington blood. Miss
Grace, I once heard one of your father&#8217;s old comrades say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
that the Colonel could keep no officers because he wore them
out, and he might have ended as General but that he reversed
the positions and wanted to instruct the War Office.
However, you mustn&#8217;t be too hard on the poor loungers;
they eat the things the other fellows grow, and some of
them subscribe the money to make the new railroads go&mdash;they
don&#8217;t always get dividends on it either. Besides,&#8221;&mdash;and
there was a twinkle in his eyes&mdash;&#8220;you are making
my new friend uncomfortable. He is a railroad builder.
Are you working for philanthropic notions, Mr. Lorimer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered soberly; and the rest of the party
laughed as I added: &#8220;Only to pay back what I owe; and
we are making slow progress in that direction. Still, the
work has its fascination, and it will last and be useful after
we are gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, while Calvert spoke to Miss Carrington, Grace
turned toward me with a sudden look of interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not exactly prospering, I gather,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
I am very sorry. Please commence when you left Fairmead
and tell me all the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did so&mdash;perhaps not very clearly, for she asked many
questions during the course of the narrative; and her eyes
sparkled at the story of our profitless struggle in the coul√©e.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flour&mdash;poor thirds; whose brand?&mdash;local pork&mdash;and
doubtless the cheapest tea, you lived on. I manage the
affairs of the Manor, and may I ask what your grocery
list came to? How much maize and oats for the horses?
Thank you. It was just as one might have expected. No,
I have never been disappointed in either Harry Lorraine
or you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dragged the particulars from me&mdash;and no one,
much less Ralph Lorimer, could refuse to answer Grace
Carrington&mdash;with a skill that came from practical knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
of such details, before I even guessed what she wished
to arrive at. Then she laughed at my confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no need to blush. Starved yourselves and
fed the cattle. It was well done. And didn&#8217;t the new
partner grumble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered, glad to change the subject. &#8220;Johnston
never grumbled at anything in his life, I think. It was he
who managed the commissariat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you realize, Mr. Lorimer, that you are in many
ways a lucky man?&#8221; she added. &#8220;I understand perfectly
what it means to lose a crop and carry out an unprofitable
contract. But it is in reference to your comrades I speak.
Fearless, loyal partners are considerably better than the
best of gear with half-hearted help, and it is evident that
you have them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said. &#8220;No man ever had better; and it is quite
true what you say. With a loyal partner a man may do
very much, and, if he is sure of himself, with a higher mind
to show him the way, he might reach out toward the heavens
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here I stopped abruptly. Wild thoughts were crystallizing
into words I might not speak, and I grew hot with
the struggle to check them, while I fancied that Grace
blushed before she turned her face away. I know my brow
was furrowed and my fingers trembled, so that it was a
relief presently to hear her musical laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not an orator,&#8221; she said, turning around
calmly; &#8220;and perhaps it is as well. It is not orators who
are wanted in this country. Your eloquent beginning too
suddenly breaks away. But don&#8217;t you think we are in the
meantime drifting into idle sentiment? And you have asked
me neither where I am going nor about Colonel Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true; the first would have seemed presumptuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and I did not care greatly about the redoubtable Colonel&#8217;s
health.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has invested some money in a new mine in the
Lonsdale district,&#8221; she said; and there was a slight cloud
on her brow as she continued: &#8220;The Manor farm has
lately cost us, through bad seasons, more than we made
from it. So, while Foster takes charge, we are going to live
in a ranch up here this summer, in order that my father
may assist in the development of the mine. He is practically
the leading partner, and until your railroad is finished
there will be serious transportation difficulties. I hope you
will come to see us often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time is up!&#8221; said Calvert.</p>
<p>I helped Grace into the saddle, and the rest of the perfect
afternoon passed like a happy dream. Even if alone, at that
season the mere sounds and scents of reawakening Nature
would have elated me; but then I strode on, holding C√¶sar&#8217;s
rein, lost in the golden glamour of it all, until snow peak
and solemn forest seemed but a fitting background for the
slender figure swaying to the horse&#8217;s stride, while the pale,
calm face brought into the shadowy aisles a charm of its own.
Once&mdash;and I could not help myself&mdash;a few lines written
by a master who loved Nature broke from me, and for a
moment Grace seemed startled. It was a passage from
the first home-coming of Queen Guinevere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we thank Providence for a good conceit of ourselves?&#8221;
she said lightly, a little later. &#8220;You are hardly a
Lancelot, Sir Railroad Builder; and she&mdash;is it a compliment
to compare me with Arthur&#8217;s faithless Queen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon I lapsed into silence, feeling like one who
has blundered on the edge of a precipice; and Grace was
silent too, for the day drew toward its close, and a red glare
of sunset came, slanting in among the massy trunks, striking
strange glints of color from her hair, while winsome and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
graceful to the tiny foot in the stirrup, her lissom shape
was outlined against it. Then for a while we left the
woods, and rode down the hillside under the last of the
afterglow, which blazed, orange, green and crimson, along
the heights of eternal snow, calling up ruby flashes from the
ragged edge of a glacier, while Grace seemed lost in wonder
and awe. I do not think there are any sunsets in the world
like those of British Columbia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unearthly&mdash;majestic!&#8221; she said half to herself.
&#8220;And once I almost felt inclined to sympathize with a
Transatlantic scribbler, who compared the Revelation to
what he termed a wholesale jewelry show. He was a townsman
who had never crossed the Rockies&mdash;and if there are
glories like this on earth, what must the everlasting city be?&#8221;</p>
<p>The weird fires paled and faded, and the peaks were
coldly solemn under their crown of snow, while a little
breeze awoke strange harmonies among the cedars, and there
was no more talking. Perhaps we were physically tired,
though that day&#8217;s march was a very slight task for me, but
I felt that after what we had seen silence became me best.
It was dark long before we rode into Cedar Crossing, and
Grace was worn-out when I helped her from the saddle.
Miss Carrington apparently found some difficulty in straightening
herself, and when Calvert had installed them in the
one second-rate hotel, after a visit to an acquaintance there,
I sat smoking beneath a hemlock most of the night keeping
guard over it. This was, of course, palpably absurd; but
I was young, and from early ages many others have done
much the same, while, though it seems the fashion to despise
all sentiment now, it is probable that future generations will
show traces of equal foolishness.</p>
<p>We finished the journey on the third day, but I did not
see Colonel Carrington. He was busy at the mine, and it
was not worth while wasting precious time in the really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
comfortable ranch he had hired, awaiting his return for the
mere pleasure of exchanging greetings with him, while Grace
was far too tired to entertain anybody.</p>
<p>Calvert looked awkward when he shook hands with me.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know how to put it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you
will understand we can&#8217;t take you away several days from
your work gratuitously, and all transport is charged to the
Syndicate. Being a trained engineer, I&#8217;m working manager,
and, as a matter of business, what do I owe you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; I answered shortly. &#8220;I could take no payment
for assisting Miss Carrington. If you like, you can
send five dollars to the Vancouver hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust we&#8217;ll be friends&#8221; said Calvert. &#8220;Hope I didn&#8217;t
offend you. Meant it in the best of faith. I&#8217;m coming
round to see you, and whenever you have leisure you must
look upon my quarters yonder as your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rode back wondering whether the work had suffered
during my absence, though I knew my partners would not
complain, and when I reached camp Harry said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly thought we&#8217;d set up as packers, but in the
meantime all is fish that comes to our net. I&#8217;m getting
quite a mercenary character. You had a long journey&mdash;how
much did you get?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;except a gift of five dollars
for the Vancouver hospital. It was Miss Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry made no articulate comment at first, though his
whistle, which from any one else would have been impertinence,
was eloquent, while some moments elapsed before he
spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s Colonel Carrington who is running the Day
Spring mine. I&#8217;ve heard the free prospectors talking about
the new Syndicate. They opine there&#8217;s nothing in it, and
that somebody is going to be hard hit.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>UNDER THE SHADOW OF DEATH</h3>
</div>

<p>In spite of the many new hands who flocked in with the
spring, the line progressed slowly. This was quite comprehensible,
and when I traveled over it afterward as a passenger
I wondered how we had ever built it at all. Portions
were hewn out of the solid rock, of a hardness that was
often too much for our most carefully tempered drills; others
were underpinned with timber against the mountain side, or
carried across deep ravines on open trestles; while much of
it had to be roofed in by massive sheds, so that the snow-slides
might not hurl it into the valley.</p>
<p>On several occasions we were almost checkmated in
our efforts to supply and clear a way for the builders.
There was, of course, no lack of timber, but the difficulty
was to get it out of the forest and into position, for we
often spent days building skidways or hewing roads to bring
the great logs down, after which it cost us even a longer
time rigging gear to lower them over dangerous ledges to
those who worked below. Still, we made progress, and the
free miners or forest ranchers who trudged behind their
weary pack-horses down the trail that crossed the track encouraged
us in their own fashion, which was at times slightly
eccentric; while now and then a party of citizens from the
struggling town rode over to inspect the new road they
hoped would do so much for them.</p>
<p>Sometimes they brought small presents with them, and
I remember one who watched our efforts admiringly said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
&#8220;You must be clearing your little pile by the way you&#8217;re
rustling,&#8221; and looked blankly incredulous when I answered:
&#8220;No; we&#8217;re only trying to pay back other men their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on occasions when the work was suspended
temporarily, I made a two days&#8217; journey to Colonel Carrington&#8217;s
ranch, and spent a few blissful hours there beneath
the cedars with his sister and Grace. Both seemed pleased
to see me, and I managed to console myself for the absence
of the Colonel and Ormond. They returned at sunset,
when I took my departure, and even Ormond was usually
disreputable of aspect. Many difficulties were connected
with the development of the Day Spring mine, and when
there was need for it Ormond showed himself a capable man
of action. Night and day the freighters met him riding
along the heavy trails, hurrying in tools and supplies, and
the shaft-sinkers said that he was always foremost when
there was risky work to be done. Once also, when I sat
smoking in Calvert&#8217;s shanty, the latter, who was freely
smeared with the green mountain clay, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are none of us exactly idlers, but Geoffrey Ormond
is tireless. In fact, I hardly recognize him as the same man,
and it is just as well. We have sunk a good deal in this
undertaking, and it will go hard with some of the Syndicate
if we don&#8217;t get out rich quartz. Ormond in particular
invested, I think, almost recklessly. He&#8217;s a distant connection
of our leader&#8217;s, you know, and it&#8217;s probable he&#8217;s hoping
for Miss Carrington&#8217;s hand. There&#8217;s no doubt that the
irascible Colonel would be glad to have him for a son-in-law,
and he is really a very good fellow, but I&#8217;m not sure that
Miss Carrington likes him&mdash;in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Calvert flicked the ash off his cigar, and looked at
me before he continued: &#8220;It&#8217;s not my business, and perhaps
I&#8217;m gossiping, but Colonel Carrington is not addicted to
changing his mind, and I anticipate a dramatic climax some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
day. In any case, she will never with his consent marry a
poor man. You can take my word for it&mdash;I&#8217;m speaking
feelingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, after exchanging a few words of cold politeness
with the Colonel, I rode homeward the next morning I
wondered whether Calvert, who certainly was not given to
gossiping, had intended this as a friendly warning. Every
one in their own manner seemed bent on warning me, and
yet, as long as Grace remained Miss Carrington, I could
not give up hope, and it was that very hope that added force
to every stroke of the glinting axe or another hour of toil to
the weary day. And so, while spring melted into summer,
I worked and waited until fate intervened.</p>
<p>Now between the mining town and Cedar the river loses
itself in a gloomy ca√±on, one of those awful gorges which
are common among the mountains of British Columbia.
Two great rocks partly close the entrance, and beyond this
the chasm is veiled in spray, while its roar when the floods
race through it can be heard several miles away. Scarcely
a ray of sunlight enters its shadowy depths, and looking up
from beside the entrance one can see the great pines that
crown the sheer fall of rock looming against the skyline in
a slender lace-like filigree. Sometimes, when frost bound
fast the feeding snows, the Siwash Indians ran their light
canoes through, but I never heard of a white man attempting
the passage, and one glance was sufficient to show the reason.
I understood it better when as by a miracle I came alive out
of the ca√±on.</p>
<p>It was a still evening, and again the afterglow flamed
behind the western pines, when, holding C√¶sar&#8217;s rein, I stood
under a hemlock talking to Grace Carrington. We had
been compelled to wait for more ironwork, and I made the
long journey on the specious excuse of visiting a certain
blacksmith who was skilled in sharpening tools. Calvert&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
offer of hospitality was now proving an inestimable boon.
Harry pointed out that we had a man in camp who could do
the work equally well, but I found a temporary deafness
convenient then.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very kind of you to suggest it, and if you could
get the things in by your supply train we should be very
glad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I really do not know whom to write to,
and the pack-horse freighters often wet or spoil them.
Aunt and I intend to spend a few days at the Lawrences&#8217;
ranch, and you could meet us with the package at the
ca√±on crossing on Thursday morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>I glanced at the list she handed me, and wondered what
Harry, who had to visit Vancouver, would say when he
found I had pledged him to ransack the dry-goods stores for
all kinds of fabrics. Still, I felt I should have faced much
more than my comrades&#8217; remonstrances to please Grace
Carrington then, as she stood beside me, glorified as it were
by the garish sunset.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aunt will be especially grateful,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And
now, good-bye. She will never forgive you if you damage
her new dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke with a half-mocking and wholly bewitching
air, for when Grace unbent she did it charmingly, holding
out a shapely hand, while the light sparkled among the
glossy clusters above her forehead. Grace&#8217;s hair might
have been intended for a net in which to catch stray sunshine.
Then while I prepared to take up the challenge the slender
fingers tightened on my own.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; she asked with a start, for a wild
shrill cry rang suddenly out of the stillness, and the hillside
returned the sound in a doleful wailing before it died away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a loon, a water-bird!&#8221; I said, though the cry
had also startled me.</p>
<p>Grace shivered as she answered: &#8220;I have never heard it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
before, and it sounded so unearthly&mdash;almost like a warning
of some evil. But it is growing late, and you have far to go.
I shall expect you at the crossing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned back toward the house, and I laughed at
my momentary confusion as I rode on through the deepening
shadow, for though it is strangely mournful the loon&#8217;s
shrill call was nothing unusual in that land. Still, mere
coincidence as it was, remembering Grace&#8217;s shiver it troubled
me, and I should have been more uneasy had I known how
we were to keep that fateful tryst.</p>
<p>It was a glorious morning when, with a package strapped
to the saddle, I rode down between the pine trunks to the
crossing. The river flashed like burnished silver below, and
the sunlight made colored haloes in the filmy spray that
drifted about the black mouth of the ca√±on, while rising
and falling in thunderous cadence the voice of many waters
rang forth from its gloomy depths. The package was a
heavy one, for there were many domestic sundries as well as
yards of dry-goods packed within it, and Harry assured me
it had taken him a whole day to procure them, adding that
he was doubtful even then whether he had satisfactorily
filled the bill.</p>
<p>I had loitered some time on the hillside until I could
see the party winding down the opposite slope. Then the
forest hid them, and it appeared that, perhaps because the
waters were high, they were not going straight to the usual
ford, but intended first to send the ladies across in a canoe
which lay lower down near a slacker portion of the rapid
stream. The slope on my own side was steep, but, picking
my way cautiously, I was not far above the river, which
boiled in a succession of white-ridged rapids, when I saw
Grace seat herself in the stern of the canoe, which Ormond
thrust off until it was nearly afloat. Then he returned for
her aunt, while Colonel Carrington and rancher Lawrence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
led the horses toward the somewhat risky ford up-stream.
The river was swollen by melting snow, and it struck me
that they would have some difficulty in crossing.</p>
<p>Then a hoarse shout rang out, &#8220;The canoe&#8217;s adrift!&#8221;
followed by another from the Colonel, &#8220;Get hold of the
paddle, Grace!&mdash;for your life paddle!&#8221;</p>
<p>It had all happened in a moment. Doubtless some slight
movement on the girl&#8217;s part had set the light Indian craft
afloat, and for another second or two I stared aghast upon
a scene that is indelibly impressed on my memory. There
was Ormond scrambling madly among the boulders, tearing
off his jacket as he ran, Colonel Carrington struggling with
a startled horse, and his sister standing rigid and still,
apparently horror-stricken, against the background of somber
pines. Then forest and hillside melted away, and while
my blood grew chill I saw only a slender white-robed figure
in the stern of the canoe, which was sliding fast toward the
head of the tossing rapid that raced in a mad seething
into the ca√±on.</p>
<p>Then I smote the horse, gripped the rein, and we were
off at a flying gallop down the declivity. A branch lashed
my forehead, sweeping my hat away; for an instant something
warm dimmed my vision, and as I raised one hand
to dash it away a cry that had a note of agony in it came
ringing down the valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make for the eddy, Grace! For heaven&#8217;s sake, paddle!&#8221;</p>
<p>How C√¶sar kept his footing I do not know. The gravel
was rattling behind us, the trunks reeled by, and the rushing
water seemed flying upward toward me. Even now I do
not think I had any definite plan, and it was only blind
instinct that prompted me to head down-stream diagonally
to cut off the approaching canoe; but I answered the
Colonel&#8217;s shout with an excited cry, and drove the horse
headlong at a shelf of rock. I felt his hoofs slipping on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
its mossy covering, there was a strident clang of iron on
stone, and then with a sudden splash we were in the torrent
together. C√¶sar must have felt the bottom beneath him a
moment or two, for I had time to free my feet from the
stirrups before he was swimming gallantly; but one cannot
take a horse on board a birch-bark canoe, and the light
shell shot down the green and white-streaked rush toward
me even as I flung myself out of the saddle. And, staring
forward with drawn-back lips and eyes wide open, I could
see the white face in the stern.</p>
<p>Thanking Providence that I could swim well, I swung
my left arm forward with hollowed palm, and shot away
from the beast with head half-buried under the side-stroke&#8217;s
impetus, making a fierce effort to gain the center of the
flow in time. Something long and dark swept past me.
With an inarticulate gasp of triumph I seized it, managed
to fall in head foremost over the stem, which in a tender
craft of that beam is a difficult thing to do, and then, snatching
the second paddle, whirled it madly. I felt the stout
redwood bend at every stroke, my lungs seemed bursting,
and there was a mist before my eyes, but it was borne in on
me that I had come too late, and that already no earthly
power could snatch us from the ca√±on.</p>
<p>Hemlock and boulder, stream-hammered reef and pine,
flitted by, closing in on one another along the half-seen
shore. The river frothed white about us in steep boiling
ridges as it raced down the incline, and nearer and nearer
ahead tossed the ghostly spray cloud that veiled the mouth
of the chasm. As we lurched broadside to the rapid each
steeper liquid upheaval broke into the canoe; for every foot
I won shoreward the stream swept us sideways two; and
when, grasping the pole, I thrust against a submerged boulder
with all my strength, the treacherous redwood snapped in
half. Then there was a bewildering roar, a blinding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
shower of spray, and we were out upon the short slide of
glassy green water which divided the tail of the rapid from
the mouth of the ca√±on. As I flung away the broken pole
and groped for the paddle I saw with eyes that were clouded
by blood and sweat Grace raise her hand as though in a
last farewell, and then as she faced round once more our
glances met. She said no word. I could not have heard
if she had, for all sound was swallowed up in one great
pulsating diapason; but she afterward said that she felt
impelled to look at me, and knew that I would turn my
head. And so for an instant, there where the barriers of
caste and wealth had melted away before the presence of
death, our two souls met in a bond that should never be
broken.</p>
<p>Now there are occasions when even the weakest seem
endowed with a special strength, while a look of blind
confidence from the woman he loves is capable of transforming
almost any man, and I knew in the exaltation of
that moment, for my own sake, I had no fear of death. If
I could not save her, I felt it would be a good end to go
down into the green depths attempting it.</p>
<p>Then the canoe lurched forward half its length clear of
the water, a white haze eddied about us, the sunlight went
out, and we were in the ca√±on, shooting down the mad rush
of a rapid toward eternity. I plied the paddle my hardest to
keep the frail craft head on, that she might not roll over by
sheering athwart the stream, not because I had any hope
of escape, but that it seemed better to go under fighting.
The work was severe enough, as, not having learned the
back-feather under water, I must dip the blade on either
side alternately, while each time that I dare turn my eyes
backward a moment the sight of Grace kneeling with set
white face in the stern further strengthened me. The pace
grew a little easier as we drew out into a somewhat slacker
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
flow, and I made shift with an empty fruit-can to free the
craft of water, until Grace spoke, and her words reached
me brokenly through the deeper growling of the river:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think there is any chance of safety?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered stoutly, though it is probable my voice
belied me. It was so strained I could hardly recognize it.
&#8220;The canoe may keep afloat until we reach the other end,
or perhaps we can find a bar to land on and climb up somewhere.&#8221;
Then I felt glad that my shoulders were turned
toward her as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid it is a very small one. There is a fall and
a whirlpool ahead, and no one could climb that awful
precipice&mdash;look!&#8221;</p>
<p>The canoe was shooting onward through dim shadow
very fast but more steadily, and raising my eyes from the
dull green water before us&mdash;these craft are always paddled
with one&#8217;s face toward the bow&mdash;I looked about me hopelessly.
In these days of easy travel there are doubtless
many who have from a securely railed-off platform gazed
down into the black depths of a Pacific Slope ca√±on upon a
river that seems a narrow thread in the great gulf below.
These will have some idea of what I saw, but they may
take the word of one who knows, which is easier than making
the experiment, that such places look very much worse
from the bottom. Those who have not may try to picture
tremendous&mdash;and the word is used with its amplest significance&mdash;walls
of slightly overhanging rock, through
which aided by grinding boulders and scoring shingle, the
river has widened as well as deepened its channel a little
every century, while between the white welter at their feet
lies a breadth of troubled green where the stream flows
heaped up, as it were, in the center.</p>
<p>In places it roared in filmy wreaths about a broken mass
of stone that cumbered the channel, but elsewhere the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
hollowed sides, upon which the smallest clawed creature
could not have found a foothold, had been worn down into
a smooth slipperiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all so horrible,&#8221; said Grace, bending back her head,
so that as I glanced over my shoulder I could see her firm
white neck through the laces as she stared upward at the
streak of blue sky so far above. Then she turned her face
toward me again, and it seemed to my excited fancy that it
had grown ethereal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may pass the whirlpool, and&mdash;if not&mdash;death can
come no harder here than in any other place,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>I tried to answer, and failed miserably, feeling glad that
an increasing tumult covered my silence, for I could not
drive out a horrible picture of that fair face with the gold
bronze hair swept in long wet wisps across it washing out,
frozen still forever, into the sunlit valley, or the soft hands
I should have given a life to kiss clutching in a last vain
agony at the cruel stones which mocked them. Then I
set my teeth, clenching the paddle until each muscle swelled
as though it would burst the skin, and, with something that
was divided between an incoherent prayer and an imprecation
upon my lips, I determined that if human flesh and
blood could save her she should not perish.</p>
<p>The roar of water grew louder and louder, rolling in
reverberations along the scarped rock&#8217;s side, until it seemed
as if the few dwarf pines which clung in odd crannies here
and there trembled in unison, and once more the white
smoke of a fall or rapid rose up close before us. Then I
could see the smooth lip of the cataract held apart, as
it were, by one curved glittering ripple from the tumult
beneath, and I remembered having heard the Indian packers
say that when shooting a low fall one has only to keep the
craft straight before the current, which is not always easy,
and let her go.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sit quite still, Grace,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;If the canoe upsets I
will at once take hold of you. We shall know the worst in
another few minutes now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips moved a little, and though I heard no words I
fancied it was a prayer, then I turned my head forward and
prepared for the struggle. I had small skill in handling
canoes, but I had more than average strength, and felt
thankful for it as, lifting the light cedar at every wrenching
stroke, I drove it toward the fall. Then a whirling
mist shot up, there was a deep booming in my ears, the
canoe leaped out as into mid-air, and I could feel her dropping
bodily from beneath us. A heavy splash followed, water
was flying everywhere, and a boiling wave lapped in, but
the paddle bent under my hand, and breathless and half-blinded
we shot out down the tail rush into daylight again.
One swift glance over my shoulder showed the slanting
spout of water behind Grace&#8217;s pallid face. The fall apparently
must have been more than a fathom in three yards
or so, and I wondered how we had ever come down it alive.</p>
<p>Then, with labored breathing and heart that thumped
painfully, I plied the paddle, while the craft swung off at a
tangent across the dark green whirling which, marked by
white concentric rings, swung round and round a down-sucking
hollow in the center. Twice we shot past the
latter, and had time to notice how a battered log of driftwood
tilted endways and went down, but as on the second
revolution we swept toward a jutting fang of quartz I made
a fierce effort, because here the stream had piled a few
yards of shingle against the foot of the rock. The craft
yielded to the impulse and drove lurching among the backwash.
Then there followed a sickening crash. Water
poured in deep over her depressed side as she swayed
downward and over, and the next moment, with one hand on
the ragged quartz and another gripping Grace&#8217;s arm, I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
struggling in the stream. Fortunately the dress fabric held,
and my failing strength was equal to the strain, for I found
a foothold, and crawled out upon the shingle, dragging her
after me. Then rising, I lurched forward and went down
headforemost with a clatter among the stones, where I lay
fighting hard for breath and overcome by the revulsion of
relief, though it may have been the mere physical overpressure
on heart and lungs that had prostrated me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>WHEN THE WATERS ROSE</h3>
</div>

<p>Presently, while I lay upon the shingle panting, a
wet hand touched my head, and looking up with dazzled
eyes I saw Grace bending down beside me. The water
drained from her garments, she was shivering, but at least
she had suffered no injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph! Ralph! tell me you are not hurt!&#8221; she said,
and something in her voice and eyes thrilled me through,
but, though I struggled to do so, I could not as yet overcome
the weakness, and lay still, no doubt a ghastly half-drowned
object, with the blood from the wound the branch
made trickling down my forehead, until stooping further
she laid her hand on my shoulder, and there was more
than compassion in the eyes that regarded me so anxiously.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, power and speech came back together,
and covering the slender fingers with kisses I staggered to
my feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God, you are safe!&#8221; I said, &#8220;and whatever
happens, I have saved you. You will forgive me this last
folly, but all the rest was only a small price to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer, though for a moment the hot blood
suffused her cheek, and I stood erect, still dazed and bewildered&mdash;for
the quartz reef had cruelly bruised me&mdash;glancing
round in search of the canoe. Failing to find it, I again
broke out gratefully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank heaven, you are safe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace leaned against a boulder. &#8220;Sit down on that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
ledge. You have not quite recovered,&#8221; she said; and I
was glad to obey, for my limbs were shaky, and the power
of command was born in her. Then with a sigh she added
very slowly: &#8220;I fear you are premature. Still, I think you
are a brave man, and no Carrington was ever a coward.
Look around and notice the level, and remember the daily
rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stupidly I blinked about me, trying to collect my scattered
wits. The strip of shingle stood perhaps a foot above
the river and was only a few yards wide. In front, the
horrible eddy lapped upon the pebbles at each revolving
swirl, and behind us rose a smooth wall of rock absolutely
unclimbable, even if it had not overhung. That, however,
was not the worst, for a numbing sense of dismay, colder
far than the chilly snow-water, crept over me as I remembered
that most mountain streams in British Columbia
rise and fall several feet daily. They are lowest in early
morning, because at night the frost holds fast the drainage
of snow-field and glacier which feeds them on the peaks
above; then, as the sun unchains the waters, they increase
in volume, so that many a ford which a man might pass
knee-deep at dawn is swept by roaring flood before the close
of afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch that stone,&#8221; said Grace with a stately calmness,
though first she seemed to choke down some obstruction in
her throat. &#8220;There! the last wash has buried it, and when
we landed the one with the red veins&mdash;it is covered several
inches now&mdash;was bare.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden fury seized me, and raising a clenched hand
aloft I ground my heels into the shingle, while Grace looked
on pityingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was almost afraid to mention it at first,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&mdash;I hoped you would take it differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then at last I began to understand clearly. I flung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
back my head as I answered: &#8220;It is not for my own miserable
safety that I care one atom. Neither if we had gone
down together in the fall would it have seemed so hard;
but after bringing you in safety so far it is horrible to be
held helpless here while inch by inch the waters rise. Great
God! is there nothing I can do? Grace, if I had ten lives
I would gladly give them all to save you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the tell-tale color flickered in her face; then it
vanished, and her voice shook a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Indeed, it seems only
too probable that you gave up one when you leaped the
poor horse into the river. It was done very gallantly, and
now you must wait as gallantly for what that great God
sends.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed so young and winsome and beautiful that
suddenly in place of rage a great pity came upon me, and I
think my eyes grew dim, for Grace looked at me very
gently as she added: &#8220;No; death comes to all of us some
time, and you must not grieve for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But because I was young and the full tide of lusty life
pulsed within me, I could not bear to think of what must
follow. Again, it seemed beyond human comprehension
that she, the incarnation of all that was fair and lovable,
must perish so miserably, and once more I had to struggle
hard to restrain a fresh outbreak of impotent fury. Presently,
however, her great fortitude infected me, and with the
calmness it brought there came a feeling that I must tell her
all now or never. Nevertheless, I felt that she knew it
already, for one glance had made many things manifest when
we first entered the ca√±on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace,&#8221; I said huskily, &#8220;I want you to listen while I
answer a question which, without speaking, you asked me&mdash;Why
should I, a rough railroad contractor, esteem it an
inestimable privilege to freely lay down my life for you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
It is only because I love you, and have done so from the
day we talked together on Starcross Moor&mdash;it seems so long
ago. Listen yet. I meant never to have told you until I
had won the right to do so, and had something to offer the
heiress of Carrington, and I fought hard for it, toiling late
and early, with a dead weight of adverse fortune against
me; but all that was little when every blow was struck for
your sweet sake. And, if you had chosen another, I should
have kept my secret, and prayed that you might be happy.
Now when, so far as worldly rank goes, we stand as equals
in the valley of death, I dare open all my heart to you; and,
if it must be, I should ask no better end than to enter eternity
here holding your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>She trembled a little, great tears were brimming in her
eyes, but again I read more than pity or sorrow in their
liquid depths, and the next moment I had spread my wet
arms about her and her head rested on my shoulder. There
are some things that concern but two souls among all those
on earth, and the low answer that came for the first time
falteringly through her lips is to be numbered among them;
but a little later, with my arm still about her, Grace smiled
up at me wistfully as the remorseless waters lapped nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved you because you were steadfast and fearless,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Sweetheart, it will not be so hard to die together
now. Do you know this is all a part of the strange memories,
as though I had learned somewhere and somehow what
was to be. Either in dreams or a mental phantasy I saw
you riding across the prairie through the whirling snow.
When you strode with bronzed face, and hard hand on my
bridle through the forest, that was familiar too, and&mdash;you
remember the passage about Lancelot&mdash;I knew you were
my own true knight. But this is not the last of the dream
forecasts or memories, and there was something brighter
beyond it I could not grasp. Perhaps it may be the glories
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
of the hereafter. I wonder whether the thought was born
when that sunset flamed and flashed?&#8221;</p>
<p>I listened, tightening my grasp about her and shivering
a little. This may have been due to physical cold, or a
suggestion of the supernatural; but Grace spoke without
terror, reverently, and ended:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, have you ever thought about that other world?
Shall we be permitted to walk hand in hand through the
first thick darkness, darling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; I cried, choking. &#8220;You shall not die. Wait
here while I try to climb round those boulders; there might
be a branch that would float us, or a log of driftwood in a
lower eddy,&#8221; and leaving her I managed with much difficulty
to scale a few great water-worn masses that had fallen from
above and shut out the view of the lower river. Still,
though I eagerly scanned the boulders scattered here and
there along the opposite bank, there was only foam and battered
stone, and at last I flung myself down dejectedly on a
ledge. I dare not go back just then and tell her that the
search was quite hopeless, and it may have been inherited
obstinacy, but I would not own myself quite beaten yet.
So I lay watching the cruel water slide past, while a host
of impossible schemes flashed through my bewildered brain.
They all needed at least a rope, or a few logs, though one
might have been rendered feasible by a small crowbar. But
I had none of these things.</p>
<p>Meantime a few white cloudlets drifted across the rift
of blue above, and a cool breadth of shadow darkened the
pine on the great rocks. Something suggested a fringe
of smaller firs along the edge of a moor in Lancashire,
and for a moment my thoughts sped back to the little gray-stone
church under the Ling Fell. Then a slow stately
droning swelled into a measured boom and I wondered
what it was, until it flashed on me that this was a funeral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
march I had once heard there on just such a day; and it
was followed by a voice reading something faint and far
away, snatches of which reached me brokenly, &#8220;In the sure
and certain hope,&#8221; and again, &#8220;Blessed are the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was, perhaps, a reason for such fancies, though I
did not know it at that time, for, as I found afterward by
the deep score across the scalp, my head must have been
driven against the stone with sufficient violence to destroy
forever the balance of a less thickly covered brain. However,
it could not have lasted more than a few moments
before I knew that the funeral march was only the boom
of the river, and if I would not have it as sole requiem for
one who was dearer far than life to me I must summon all
my powers of invention. The waters had risen several
inches since I first flung myself down. Great events hang
on very small ones, and we might well have left our bones
in the ca√±on, but that when crawling over a boulder I slipped
and fell heavily, and, when for a moment I lay with my
head almost in the river, I could see from that level something
in the eddy behind a rock on the further shore which
had remained unnoticed before.</p>
<p>It was a dark object, half-hidden among grinding fragments
of driftwood and great flakes of spume, but I caught
hard at my breath when a careful scrutiny showed that
beyond all doubt it was the overturned canoe. Still, at
first sight, it seemed beyond the power of flesh and blood to
reach it. The rapid would apparently sweep the strongest
swimmer down the ca√±on, while the revolving pool span
suggestively in narrowing circles toward the deadly vortex
where the main rush from the fall went down. Second
thought, however, suggested there might be a very small
chance that when swept round toward the opposite shore
one could by a frantic struggle draw clear of the rotary
swirl into the downward flow, which ran more slackly close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
under the bank. I came back and explained this to Grace,
and then for the first time her courage gave way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No one could swim
through that awful pool, and&mdash;I am only a woman, weak
after all&mdash;I could not stay here and see you drown. Ralph,
it was the thought of having you beside me that gave me
courage&mdash;you must not leave me alone to the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our last chance, sweetheart,&#8221; I said very slowly,
&#8220;and we dare not neglect it, but I will make a promise. If
I feel my strength failing, when I know I can do no more,
I will come back to you. Standing here you could reach
my hand as the eddying current sweeps me round. Now,
wish me good fortune, darling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace stooped and kissed my forehead, for even as I
spoke I knelt to strip off the long boots. This was no time
for useless ceremony. Then with a faint ghost of a blush
she added, &#8220;You must not be handicapped&mdash;fling away
your jacket and whatever would hamper you,&#8221; after which,
standing beside me at the edge of the water, she said very
solemnly, &#8220;God bless and keep you, Ralph.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I whirled both hands above my head, leaped out
from the quartz shelf, and felt the chilly flood part before
me until, instead of dull green transparency, there was
daylight about me again, and my left hand swept forward
through the air with the side-stroke which in younger days
I had taken much pains to cultivate. Now there was the
hardness in muscles which comes from constant toil behind
it, besides a force which I think was not born altogether of
bodily strength, and even then I could almost rejoice to feel
the water sweep past me a clear half-fathom as the palm
drove backward hollowed to the hip, while the river boiled
and bubbled under my partly submerged head. But I swung
right around the eddy, and almost under the tail rush of
the fall, while once for a moment I caught sight of Grace&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
intent face as, husbanding my strength for a few seconds, I
passed tossed about on the confused welter close by the
quartz shelf. Then, as the circling waters hurried me a
second time round and outward toward the further shore,
I made what I knew must be the last effort, made it with
cracking sinews and bursting lungs, and drew clear by a
foot or two of the eddy&#8217;s circumference. A few more strokes
and an easy paddling carried me down-stream, and a wild
cry of triumph, which more resembled a hoarse cackle than a
shout, went up when at last I drew myself out of the water
beside the canoe.</p>
<p>I lay on the cold stone breathing hard for several minutes;
then I managed to drag the light shell out and empty her,
after which I tore up a strip of the cedar flooring to form a
paddle, and found that though one side was crushed the
damage was mostly above flotation level. It would serve
no purpose to narrate the return passage, and it was sufficiently
arduous, but a man in the poorest craft with a paddle
has four times the power of any swimmer, and at last I
reached the shingle, which was almost covered now. Grace
stood on the brink to meet me with a cry of heartfelt
relief when I ran in the bows, then a momentary dizziness
came upon me, as, all dripping as I was, I lifted her into the
stern. After I thrust off the craft, and, struggling clear
of the eddy, we shot away on the outgoing stream, she smiled
as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was splendidly done! Ralph, is it foolish&mdash;I once
supposed it would be so&mdash;that because you have the strength
to do these things you make me proud of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is little more to tell, and that passage through
the ca√±on left behind it an unpleasant memory. Though
it was rising all the time, the stream ran more evenly, there
were no more cataracts or whirlpools, and while Grace
was obliged to bail hard with&mdash;so closely does burlesque
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
follow on tragedy&mdash;one of my long boots, she could keep
the leaks under. I did my best with the paddle, for I
could see the tension was telling on her, and at last the
great rock walls fell back on either hand, and dwarf pines
and juniper climbed the less precipitous slopes, until these
too opened out into a wide valley, and we slid forth safely
into clear sunlight. Never had brightness and warmth so
rejoiced me as they did after the cold damp horror of that
passage through the dark rift in the earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE RETURN</h3>
</div>

<p>It was James Lawrence, the English rancher, and Miss
Carrington who told me what happened to those we left
behind after the fateful moment when the canoe first slipped
clear of the shingle bank. Lawrence accompanied the party
on their return journey, and it was he who suggested sending
Grace and Miss Carrington across in the canoe. The river
ran high that morning, and he felt dubious about the ford,
because several pack-horses had already been drowned there.</p>
<p>The first intimation he had of anything wrong was a
cry from the girl, and he saw a strip of water widen between
the canoe and the bank. He ran his hardest, but made
little headway, for thorny bushes and fern formed thickets
along the bank, while when he reached the boulders he felt
that he had come too late, because no swimmer could then
overtake the canoe, even if he escaped destruction in the
first rapid immediately below. Nevertheless, after a glance
at the drawn face of the girl, which haunted him long afterward,
as with the first shock of terror on her she labored
helplessly at the paddle, he would even have made the hopeless
attempt but that Colonel Carrington, who of all the
trio had retained his common sense, intervened. It was
not without reason that the Colonel had earned the reputation
of being a hard man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back! Stop him! Geoffrey, are you mad?&#8221;
he roared; and Lawrence, who had now recovered his wits,
flung himself upon a man who, stripping himself to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
waist as he ran, floundered at breakneck speed among the
boulders. They went down together heavily, and the next
moment the runner had him by the throat, hissing through
his teeth, &#8220;Let go, you fool, before I murder you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawrence was strong, however, and held fast half-choked
for a moment or two, until the Colonel&#8217;s cry reached them
again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, Geoffrey, you lunatic! Follow, and head them
off along the bank!&#8221;</p>
<p>The shouts and the confusion had startled his restive
horse, and by the time he had mounted the pair were on
their feet again stumbling over the boulders or smashing
through the undergrowth in a desperate race, with the horse
blundering behind them and the canoe ahead. They might
possibly have overtaken it except for the rapid, Lawrence
said, but it swept like a toboggan down that seething rush,
and, as realizing that it was almost hopeless, they held on,
there was a clatter on the opposite slope, and they saw me
break out at headlong gallop from the woods. They halted
when I crawled into the canoe, for we were beyond all
human help from that bank now; and, flinging himself from
the saddle, Colonel Carrington stood with clenched hands
and quivering lips, staring after us, so Lawrence said, out
of awful eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; he gasped at length. &#8220;He&#8217;ll reach the gravel-spit.
Another two good strokes&mdash;they&#8217;re almost in the
eddy;&#8221; but the next words were frozen on his lips, for the
backwash from a boulder swept away the bows of the canoe,
and the words that followed came hoarse and brokenly,
&#8220;My God&mdash;he&#8217;s too late!&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Carrington was right, for, as held still and spellbound
they watched, the canoe leaped down the entrance
rapid and was lost in the mist of the black ca√±on. The
Colonel said nothing further, though he groaned aloud, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Lawrence did not care to look at him; but Ormond&#8217;s face
was ashy until a livid fury filled it as he turned upon the
rancher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confusion to you! Why must you stop me then?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would only have drowned yourself in the rapid and
done nobody any good,&#8221; Lawrence said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to heaven I had,&#8221; answered Ormond, with cold
deliberateness. &#8220;As it is, you have helped that man to rob
me again, even at the last, and I would give all I have
to change places now with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, while Lawrence wondered what he meant, though
when I heard the story I fully understood, the head of my
horse rose for an instant out of the tumbling waters, sank,
and rising, went down again, while a tremor ran through
the Colonel&#8217;s rigid frame, and he leaned against a hemlock
with great beads of sweat on his forehead. The poor beast
had doubtless been mangled against a boulder, and the sight
was horribly suggestive.</p>
<p>&#8220;A very grim man,&#8221; said Lawrence, when he narrated
what happened; &#8220;but I felt most cruelly sorry for him.
Didn&#8217;t say very much&mdash;his sort never do; but he was
in mortal anguish, and I knew how he would miss the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Carrington was, nevertheless, the first to master
his feelings, and his voice was steady once more when he
turned to Ormond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geoffrey, you will go back and send my sister round
with the Indian by Tomlinson&#8217;s crossing. Then you will
return and overtake us in the ravine yonder. We are
going to follow the crest of the ca√±on to&mdash;to&mdash;see what we
can find.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a stiff climb up the ravine, trying in places to a
mountaineer, but the old man held close behind his companion,
and Lawrence wondered at him. He also felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
sorry for Ormond, whose task it was to overtake them, but
when at last they hurried breathless through the pinewoods
toward the edge of the chasm above the fall, the latter,
looking like a ghost, came panting up with them. Then,
standing on the dizzy brink, Colonel Carrington gazed down
at the spout of green water and the whirling spray, which
were dwarfed by the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the greatest danger, that and the whirlpool.
Anything would swing round in the eddy, would it not?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Now, I want only the truth&mdash;you understand
these rivers&mdash;could any white man take a canoe down there
and through the pool safely?&#8221; and Lawrence, who dare not
prevaricate with that gaze upon him, answered reluctantly,
&#8220;I do not think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel&#8217;s thin face twitched. &#8220;I thank you. No
other possible landing place or foothold, is there? And
it would take a day to go back to Tomlinson&#8217;s and portage
a canoe. Well, we&#8217;ll go on to the end in a last hope that
they have got through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now climbing is difficult in that region, because where
the mountain slopes do not consist of almost precipitous
snow-ground rock, they are clothed with forest and dense
undergrowth, and it was therefore some time before the
three had traversed the league or so that divided the summit
from the outlet valley. Neither when they got there did
they find the canoe, because when I helped Grace ashore I
did not care where it went, and, once on terra firma she
fainted suddenly, and then lay for a time sobbing on my
shoulder in a state of nervous collapse. As she said, though
a brave one, she was after all only a woman, and what had
happened would have tested the endurance of many a man.
At last, however, I managed to help her up a ravine leading
down to the river, after which she leaned heavily on my
arm as we plodded through the forest until we reached a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
small rancher&#8217;s shanty, where, as the owner was absent, I
took the liberty of lighting his stove and preparing hot tea.
Then I left Grace to dry her garments.</p>
<p>We must have spent several hours at the ranch, for
Grace was badly shaken, and I felt that rest was needful
for both of us, while, when I returned to the cabin after
drying myself in the sun, she lay back in a hide-chair
sleeping peacefully. So while the shadows of the firs lengthened
across the clearing I sat very still, until with a light
touch I ventured to rouse her. She woke with a gasp of
horror, looked around with frightened eyes, then clung to
me, and I knelt beside the chair with my arms about her,
until at last with a happy little laugh she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, I have lost my character, and you know I am a
coward at heart; but, and until to-day I should not have
believed it, it is so comforting to know I have a&mdash;I have
you to protect me.&#8221; Then she laid her hand on my brow,
adding gently, &#8220;Poor forehead that was wounded in my
service! But it is getting late, Ralph, and my father will
be feverishly anxious about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace was right in this, because, long before we borrowed
the rancher&#8217;s Cayuse pony and set out again, Colonel Carrington
and the others reached the bank of the river, and
saw only a broad stretch of muddy current racing beneath
the rigid branches of the firs. Then after they had searched
the few shingle bars&mdash;the one we landed on was by this
time covered deeply&mdash;the old man sat down on a boulder
apart from the rest, and neither dare speak to him, though
Lawrence heard him say softly to himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter&mdash;my daughter! I would to God I might
join her.&#8221;</p>
<p>They turned homeward in solemn silence, though perhaps
a last spark of hope burned in the Colonel&#8217;s breast that
by some wholly unexpected chance we had reached it before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
they did, because Lawrence said he seemed to make a stern
effort to restrain himself when they saw only Miss Carrington
sitting dejectedly near the window. Thereupon Lawrence
was glad to escape, and Ormond, who rode out to
gather the miners for a systematic search, left them mercifully
alone.</p>
<p>Afterward the old man brokenly narrated what had passed,
and then there was a heavy silence in the room, out of
which the sunlight slowly faded, until, as Miss Carrington
told me, the ticking of a nickeled clock grew maddening.
At last she rose and flung the window open wide, and the
sighing of the pines drifted in mournfully with a faint coolness
that came down from the snow. Meantime, Colonel
Carrington paced with a deadly regularity up and down,
neither speaking nor glancing at her, until he started as a
faint beat of horse hoofs came out of the shadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Geoffrey returning!&#8221; he said bitterly. &#8220;But I
have been listening, listening every moment for the last
hour. It is utterly hopeless, I know, and we must bear the
last black sorrow that has fallen upon us; but yet I cannot
quite believe her dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tramp of hoofs grew nearer, and the Colonel leaned
out through the open casement with the hand that gripped
its ledge quivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an Indian pony, not Geoffrey&#8217;s horse, and a man
on foot is leading it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are coming this way;
I will meet them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Carrington, however, laid a restraining grasp upon
him, and very slowly the clock ticked off the seconds until,
when two figures came out through the thinning forest into
the clearing, the Colonel&#8217;s face grew white as death. For a
moment he choked for breath, and his sister sobbed aloud
when he recovered himself, for she too had seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank a merciful Providence&mdash;it is Grace,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>I lifted Grace from the pony&#8217;s back, led her toward the
house, and saw the old man fold his arms about her. Then
I heard her happy cry, and while for a time they forgot all
about me, I stood holding the pony&#8217;s rein and thinking.
My first impulse was to go forward and claim her before
them, but that was too much like taking advantage of her
father&#8217;s relief. Also, I felt that some things are sacred, and
the presence of any stranger would be an intrusion then,
while it seemed hardly fitting to forthwith demand such a
reward for what any other should doubtless have done gladly.
So, trusting that Grace would understand, I turned away,
determined to call on the Colonel the next morning, and,
though I am not sure that the result would otherwise have
been different, I afterward regretted it. Now I know that
any excess of delicacy or consideration for others which
may cause unnecessary sorrow to those nearest us is only
folly.</p>
<p>No one called me back, or apparently noticed me, and
though with much difficulty I reached the ranch, and was
hospitably entertained there, I never closed my eyes all
night. I returned to the Colonel&#8217;s dwelling as early as
possible the next morning, and was at once received by him.
The events of the preceding day had left their impression
even on him, and for once his eyes were kindly, while it
was with perceptible emotion he grasped my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am indebted to you for life, and you acted with discernment
as well as gallantry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have an old
man&#8217;s fervent thanks, and if he can ever repay such a service
you may rely on his gratitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not know why, for they were evidently sincere enough,
but the words struck me unpleasantly. They seemed to
emphasize the difference between us, and there was only
one favor I would ever ask of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can return it now with the greatest honor it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
in your power to grant any living man,&#8221; I answered bluntly.
&#8220;I ask the promise of Miss Carrington&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>I feel sure now that there was pity in his eyes for a moment,
though I scarcely noticed it then, and he answered
gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry. You have asked the one thing impossible.
When Miss Carrington marries it will be in accordance
with my wishes and an arrangement made with a dead kinsman
long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think he would have continued, but that I broke in:
&#8220;But I love her, and she trusts me. Ever since I came to
this country I have been fighting my way upward with this
one object in view. We are both young, sir, and I shall
not always be poor&mdash;&#8221; but here he stopped me with a
gesture, repeating dryly, &#8220;I am sorry for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paced the long room twice before he again turned
toward me, saying with a tone of authority, &#8220;Sit down there.
I am not in the habit of explaining my motives, but I will
make an exception now. My daughter has been brought
up luxuriously, as far as circumstances permitted, and in her
case they permitted it in a measure even on the prairie&mdash;I
arranged it so. She has scarcely had a wish I could not
gratify, and at Carrington Manor her word was law. I
need hardly say she ordered wisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>I bent my head in token of comprehension and agreement
as the speaker paused, and then, with a different and incisive
inflection, he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;And what would her life be with you? A constant
battle with hardship and penury on a little prairie farm,
where with her own hands she must bake and wash and sew
for you, or, even worse, a lonely waiting in some poor lodging
while you were away months together railroad building.
Is this the lot you would propose for her? Now, and there
is no reason I should explain why, after my death there will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
be little left her besides an expensive and occasionally unprofitable
farm, and so I have had otherwise to provide for
her future!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are, however, two things you take for granted,&#8221;
I interposed again; &#8220;that I shall never have much to offer
her&mdash;and in this I hope you may be wrong&mdash;and Miss
Carrington&#8217;s acquiescence in your plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old grim smile flickered in the Colonel&#8217;s eyes as he
answered: &#8220;Miss Carrington will respect her father&#8217;s wishes&mdash;she
has never failed to do so hitherto&mdash;and I do not
know that there is much to be made out of such railroad
contracts as your present one.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was certainly true enough, and I winced under the
allusion before I made a last appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suppose, sir, that after all fortune favored me,
and there was some reason why what you look for failed to
come about&mdash;all human expectation, human life itself, is uncertain&mdash;would
you then withhold your consent?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at me keenly a moment, saying nothing, and it
was always unpleasant to withstand the semi-ironical gaze
of Colonel Carrington, though I had noticed a slight movement
when quite at random I alluded to the uncertainty of
life. Then he answered slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think in that case we could discuss all this again,
though it would be better far for you to consider my refusal
as definite. Now I have such confidence in my daughter&#8217;s
obedience that on the one condition that you do not seek to
prejudice her against me I do not absolutely forbid your
seeing Miss Carrington&mdash;on occasion&mdash;but you must write
no letters, and you may take it as a compliment that I should
tell you I have acted only as seemed best in her interest.
Neither should it be needful to inform you that she will
never marry without my consent. And now, reiterating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
my thanks, I fail to see how anything would be gained
by prolonging this interview.&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew from his face that this was so, and that further
words might be a fatal mistake, and I went out hurriedly,
forgetting, I am afraid, to return his salutation, though
when I met his sister she glanced at me with sympathy as
she pointed toward another door. When I entered this
Grace rose to meet me. The time we spent in the ca√±on
had drawn us closer together than many months of companionship
might have done, and it was with no affectation
of bashful diffidence that she beckoned me to a place beside
her on the casement logs, saying simply, &#8220;You have bad
news, sweetheart. Tell me everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father had exacted no promise about secrecy. Indeed,
if the arrangement mentioned compromised a prospective
husband, as I thought it did, Grace was doubtless fully
acquainted with it; and I told her what had passed. Then
she drew herself away from me.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is there nothing to be added? Have you lost your
usual eloquence?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;I was coming to it. It is this:
while I live I will never abandon the hope of winning you;
and, with such a hope, whatever difficulty must be grappled
with first, I know that some day I shall do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Grace, with a heightened color, and her liquid
eyes shining, &#8220;is there still nothing else?&#8221; And while I
glanced at her in a bewildered fashion she continued, &#8220;Do
you, like my father, take my consent for granted? Well, I
will give it to you. Ralph, while you are living, and after,
if you must go a little before I do, I will never look with
favor upon any man. Meantime, sweetheart&mdash;for, as he
said, I will not resist my father&#8217;s will, save only in one matter&mdash;you
must work and I must wait, trusting in what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
the future may bring. And so&mdash;you must leave me now;
and it may be long before I see you. Go, and God bless
you, taking my promise with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laid her little hand in mine, and I bent down until
the flushed face was level with my own. When I found
myself in the open air again, I strode through the scented
shadows triumphantly. The Colonel&#8217;s opposition counted
as nothing then. I was sanguine and young, and I knew, because
she had said it, that until I had worsted fortune Grace
Carrington would wait for me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE OPENING OF THE LINE</h3>
</div>

<p>During the weeks that followed I saw neither Grace
nor Colonel Carrington&mdash;though the latter fact did not
cause me unnecessary grief, and we heard much about his
doings. From what the independent miners who strolled
into our camp at intervals told us, the Day Spring shaft
had proved a costly venture, and had so far failed to lay
bare any traces of payable milling ore. Still, the redoubtable
Colonel continued with his usual tenacity, and was now
driving an adit into the range side to strike the quartz reef
at another level.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a blamed sight more gold going into them
diggings than they&#8217;ll ever get out, and the man who is running
them will make a big hole in somebody&#8217;s bank account,&#8221;
said one informant meditatively. &#8220;However, there&#8217;s no
use wasting time trying to give him advice. I strolled round
one morning promiscuous, and sat down in his office. &#8216;See
here, Colonel, you&#8217;re ploughing a bad patch,&#8217; I says, &#8216;and
having a knowledge of good ones I might tell you something
if I prowled through your workings.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; asked Harry, smiling at me. And
the narrator expectorated disgustedly as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just turned round and stared&mdash;kind of combine between
a ramrod and an icicle. &#8216;Who the perdition are
you?&#8217; he said&mdash;or he looked it, anyway. So, seeing him
above a friendly warning, I lit out, feeling sheep-faced; and
I&#8217;ve bluffed some hard men in my time. Since then I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
been rooting round, and I&#8217;m concluding there is good ore
in that mountain, if he could strike it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the sheep-faced feeling, Ralph?&#8221; asked
Harry mischievously. And probably my frown betrayed
me, because I knew it well, though there was some consolation
in the thought that this reckless wanderer of the
ranges knew it also.</p>
<p>In any case, I had small leisure just then to trouble about
the affairs of Colonel Carrington. My duty to my partners
and the men who worked for us was sufficiently onerous,
for we had almost daily to grapple with some fresh natural
difficulty. Twice a snow-slide awakened majestic
thunders among the hills at night and piled the wreckage
of the forests high upon the track. Massy boulders charged
down the slopes and smashed the half-finished snow-shed
framing into splinters; but, rod by rod, the line stretched on,
and the surveyor&#8217;s good-will increased toward us. So the
short weeks passed, until at last the metals led into the
mining town, and its inhabitants made preparations to provide
a fitting reception for the first train, the arrival of which
would mark a turning-point in the wooden city&#8217;s history.
I can remember each incident of that day perfectly, because
it also marked the change from ebb to flood in the tide of
our own affairs. We sat up late the previous night calculating
the amount to our debit, which proved sufficiently discouraging,
and endeavoring to value on the credit side work
we had done in excess of contract; but this, Harry said, was
reckoning without our host, as represented by the surveyor,
who, when we approached him on the subject, displayed a
becoming reticence.</p>
<p>It was a glorious afternoon when we stood waiting beside
the track, attired for once in comparatively decent garments.
Harry and I had spent several hours in ingenious repairs,
one result of which was that certain seams would project
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
above the surface in spite of our efforts to restrain them.
Beneath us the foaming river made wild music in its hidden
gorge, and the roar of a fall drifted up with the scent of
cedars across the climbing pines, while above the hill-slopes
led the gaze upward into the empyrean. But there is no
need for description; we were in the mountains of British
Columbia, and it was summertime.</p>
<p>Near at hand many banners fluttered over the timber
city, and discordant strains announced the last rehearsal of
the miner&#8217;s band, while a throng of stalwart men laughed
and jested as they gazed expectantly up the line. They
had cause for satisfaction. All had waited long and
patiently, paying treble value for what they used or ate,
and struggling with indifferent implements to uncover the
secret treasure of the ranges. Now their enterprise would
not be handicapped by the lack of either plant or capital,
for the promise given had been redeemed, and with the advent
of the locomotive they looked for the commencement
of a great prosperity.</p>
<p>My face, however, was somber, for Harry made some
jesting comparison between it and that of a mourner at a
funeral. We, too, had done our share in the building of
the road, but, as far as we could see, it had signally failed
to bring us prosperity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can console yourself with the feeling that it&#8217;s good
to be a public benefactor, even if you don&#8217;t get any money,&#8221;
said Harry cheerfully. &#8220;Did it ever strike you, Ralph,
that the people who subscribe for statues make a bad choice
of their models? Instead of the frock-coated director they
should set up the man with the shovel&mdash;Ralph Lorimer,
rampant, clad in flour bags, and heaving aloft the big axe,
for instance, with the appropriate motto round the pedestal
under him, &#8217;Virtue is its own reward.&#8217; No, I&#8217;m in charge
of the pulpit this afternoon, Lee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>What the shoemaker intended to say did not appear, for
he smilingly abandoned the opportunity for improving the
occasion. He had put on flesh and vigor, and now, instead
of regarding him as a flippant worldling, which was formerly
his plainly expressed opinion, he even looked up in a curious
way toward my partner, and once informed me that there
was a gradely true soul in him under his nonsense. The
spell of the mountains and the company of broad-minded
cheerful toilers had between them done a good deal for Lee.
Then up on the hillside a strip of bunting fluttered from
the summit of a blighted pine, the cry &#8220;She&#8217;s coming!&#8221;
rolled from man to man, and there was a thunderous crash
as some one fired a heavy blasting charge. A plume of
white vapor rose at the end of the valley, and twinkling
metal flashed athwart the pines, while a roar of voices broke
out and my own heart beats faster in the succeeding stillness.
Enthusiasm is contagious, and a feeling of elation grew
upon me. Nearer and nearer came the cars, and when they
lurched clattering up the last grade the snorting of the
huge locomotive and the whir of flying wheels made very
sweet music to those who heard them.</p>
<p>Then as, with the red, quartered ensign fluttering above
the head-lamp and each end platform crowded, the train
passed the last construction camp, a swarm of blue-shirted
toilers cast their hats into the air, and the scream of the
brakes was drowned in a mighty cheer, while I found myself
cheering vehemently among the rest. The blasts ceased at
the funnel, and as the slackening couplings clashed while
the cars rolled slowly through the eddying dust I started in
amaze, for there were two faces at the unglazed windows of
the decorated observation car which I knew well, but had
never expected to see there. Martin Lorimer waved his
hand toward me as the train stopped, my cousin Alice stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
beside him smiling a greeting, and with shame I remembered
how long it was since I had sent news to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen a ghost?&#8221; asked Harry. &#8220;You are a
regular Don Juan. Who is that dainty damsel you are
honoring with such marked attention, to the neglect of your
lawful business. Don&#8217;t you see the surveyor is beckoning
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was true, for, standing among a group of elderly
men who I supposed were railway magnates or guests of importance,
the surveyor, to my astonishment, called me by
name.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been looking for you all along the track,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Must present you to these gentlemen. We have been discussing
your work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several of the party shook hands with me frankly, while
the names the surveyor mentioned were already well-known
in Winnipeg and Montreal, and have since become famous
throughout the Dominion. One with gray hair and an
indefinable stamp of authority touched my shoulder with a
friendly gesture. &#8220;I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr.
Lorimer before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have some business together,
and expect you to join us in the opening ceremony.
Meantime, you will excuse me&mdash;Jardine, I&#8217;m thankful it is
your turn. There is evidently a deputation coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Preceded by tossing banners, and a band which made up
in vigor what it lacked in harmony, a procession approached
the train, and its leader commenced reading something
awkwardly from a written paper in time to an undercurrent
of semi-ironical encouragement. I saw some of the visitors&#8217;
eyes twinkle at his sentiments, but for the most part they
listened with becoming gravity; and when a man with gold
eyeglasses had suitably replied, there was a wild scuffle for
even a foothold on the train. One musician smote another,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
who strove to oust him from a platform, with his cornet,
which promptly doubled in; the big drum rolled down a
declivity with its owner hurling back wild language in
frantic chase of it; then the locomotive snorted, and, with
the bell clanging, it hauled the first train into the wooden
town amid the acclamations of the populace. After this I
had an opportunity for greeting my uncle, and we looked at
each other with mutual curiosity. Martin Lorimer seemed
thinner and older. His hair was freely sprinkled with white
now, but his eyes were as keen as ever, and I could read approval
in them. Then as Alice came toward us from an
adjoining car he laughed boisterously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of your cousin, lass?&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
left us an obstinate stripling, and this country has hammered
him into a man. Thou art a credit to the land that bred
thee, lad. Ralph, I wronged thee sorely, like the blundering
fool I am, and first of all I ask thy forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Lorimer could speak excellent modern English
when he liked, and usually did so, but, and in this he resembled
others of his kind, in times of excitement he used
the older form which is still the tongue of Lancashire. I
made some haphazard answer, but it seemed appropriate, for
Alice smiled upon us as we shook hands heartily. When I
turned toward her a feeling of pity came upon me&mdash;she
looked so wan and frail. Still her eyes were bright with
good-will, and her voice seemed to tremble a little as she
said, &#8220;I am so glad to see you and your uncle good friends
again. He was very stupid, and I told him so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, lass,&#8221; said Martin Lorimer, &#8220;many a time, and
we had words upon it. We&#8217;re a thick-headed people, Ralph,
except for our womenkind, and if we&#8217;re slow to think evil
we&#8217;re slow to change. The Lord forgive me for pig-headed
folly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I show you this wonderful township?&#8221; interrupted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
one of the railroad magnates approaching with a bow.
&#8220;Mr. Ralph Lorimer, I am desired to invite you to the celebration
dinner. It&#8217;s the chief&#8217;s especial wish that you should
be present,&#8221; and he drew Alice away, leaving my uncle and
myself alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go and see the city, too,&#8221; said the former. &#8220;Already
the air of your mountains makes me young again.
Never heard how I cheated the doctors, eh?&mdash;they badly
wanted to bury me, but I&#8217;ll tell you all about it another
time. Now I feel like a school lad out for a holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed in excellent spirits, and with me the bright
sunshine, the uproarious rejoicings of the crowd, and the
events of the past half-hour combined to banish all depression,
while many an acquaintance smiled as he glanced at the
grizzled man in tourist tweeds who chatted gaily and gazed
about him with wondering eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You breed fine men over here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Never saw a
finer set anywhere. Bless me! look at that one striding
toward us with the air of a general; stamp of blood about
him; where did he get it? And yet by the look of him that
fellow could do a hard day&#8217;s work with any British navvy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can,&#8221; I answered smiling, &#8220;and he was taught at a
British university. Now he hews logs for a living, and
sometimes works for me. Let me introduce you to my uncle
from Lancashire, Martin Lorimer&mdash;Lance Chisholm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very glad to meet you, sir,&#8221; said the latter. &#8220;I
promised to look in on Morgan in the saloon; will you join
us?&#8221;</p>
<p>When we elbowed our way through the noisy room toward
the bar Chisholm proffered the usual refreshment, and with
a comprehensive wave of his hand bade the tender, &#8220;Set
them up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Lorimer stared bewilderedly at the row of glasses
deftly flung in front of him, and there was a roar of laughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
when, glancing at me appealingly, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a hospitable
country; but, bless us, Ralph! are we expected to drink all
of this? And I&#8217;m a churchwarden!&#8221;</p>
<p>A bearded giant in blue jean smote him on the shoulder.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the right grit in you, stranger,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Start
right in, and do the best you can,&#8221; while the old man joined
in the merriment when I explained that the invitation included
all in the vicinity who cared to accept it. I left him
with Harry and Johnston presently because one of the guests
brought word that Alice desired to see me, and I found her
on the veranda of the best house the citizens could place at
the strangers&#8217; disposal. There were ladies among them. I
drew two chairs into a corner where a flowering creeper
screened half the trellis, and from where we sat a wonderful
vista rolled away before us. Alice had changed but little,
save that she seemed even more delicate. I had changed
much, and now as we chatted with a resumption of ancient
friendliness I wondered how it was that her innate goodness
and wisdom had never impressed me more in the old days.
Few would have called her handsome at first sight, but she
was dowered with qualities that were greater than beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will wonder what brought us here,&#8221; she said at
length, &#8220;and your uncle forgot to tell you. Ever after
that&mdash;unfortunate mistake&mdash;he talked constantly about
our headstrong lad, but when he lay dangerously ill for weeks
together I was unable to write you. The doctors had little
hope most of the time, and one said he recovered chiefly because
he had made his mind up he would not die, and when
they forbade all thought of business and recommended travel
he made me buy the latest map of Canada, and we are now
staying at the new mountain chalet. My own health has
not improved latterly, and that helped to decide him. We
left the main line on the prairie and went south in search of
you, and when we could only discover that you had gone to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
British Columbia I am sorry to say that my father expressed
his disappointment very forcibly&mdash;but you know his way.
Then while we stayed at the chalet we read about the opening
of the new line, and he grew excited at a mention of
your name. &#8216;We&#8217;ll go right down and see that opening,
lass,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I&#8217;ve a letter to one of the railroad leaders,
and I&#8217;ll make him invite us;&#8217; and so we came. When my
father sets his heart on anything he generally obtains it.
Now we will talk about Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flowering creeper partly hid us, but it left openings
between, framing the prospect of glittering peak and forest-filled
valley with green tracery, while warm sunlight beat
through. So, in contrast to the past, I found it comforting
to lounge away the time there with a fair companion, while
glancing down the glistening metals I told how we had
built the line. Alice was a good listener, and the tale may
have had its interest, while&mdash;and this is not wholly due to
vanity&mdash;no man talks better than when he speaks to a
sympathizing woman of the work that he is proud of. It
was no disloyalty to Grace, but when once or twice she laid
her thin hand on my arm I liked to have it there, and see
the smile creep into her eyes when I told of Lee&#8217;s doings.
So the minutes fled, until at last a shadow fell upon us, and
I saw Grace pass close by with her father. For an instant
her eyes met mine, then I felt that they rested on my companion,
whose head was turned toward me confidentially and
away from Grace, and I fumed inwardly, for she spoke to
the Colonel and passed on without a greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is surely Miss Carrington,&#8221; said Alice looking
up later with a faintly perceptible trace of resentment.
&#8220;Why did she not speak to either of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a troublesome question, because I could not well
explain what my exact relations were with Grace, nor how
her father&#8217;s presence might perhaps restrain her, so that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
was glad when Martin Lorimer suddenly joined us. It
seemed fated that circumstances should array themselves
against me. The rest of the afternoon was spent in hilarious
merriment, and, though as a rule the inhabitants of that
region are a peaceful folk, a few among them celebrated
the occasion by breaking windows with pistol shots and
similar vagaries. Still, even those who owned the glass
took it in good part; and, as darkness fell, considerably more
of the populace than it was ever intended to hold squeezed
themselves into the wooden building which served as city
hall, while the rest sat in the dust outside it, and cheered for
no particular reason at regular intervals.</p>
<p>The best banquet the district could furnish was served
in the hall, and I sat opposite the surveyor near the head
of one table, with my uncle and Alice close by, and Grace
and Colonel Carrington not far away. Cedar sprays and
branches of balsam draped the pillars, the red folds of the
beaver ensign hung above our heads, and as usual the assembly
was democratic in character. Men in broadcloth and
in blue jean sat side by side&mdash;rail-layer, speculator, and
politician crowded on one another, with stalwart axe-men,
some of whom were better taught than either, and perhaps a
few city absconders, to keep them company; but there was
only good-fellowship between them. The enthusiasm increased
with each orator&#8217;s efforts, until the surveyor made
in his own brusque fashion, which was marked by true
Western absence of bashfulness, the speech of the evening.
Some one who had once served the English press sent a
report to a Victoria journal, of which I have a copy, but no
print could reproduce the essence of the man&#8217;s vigorous personality
which vibrated through it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What built up the Western Dominion, called leagues
of wheat from the prairie, and opened the gate of the mountains&mdash;opened
it wide to all, with a welcome to the Pacific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Slope paradise?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The conundrum&#8217;s easy&mdash;just
the railroad. Good markets and mills, say the city men,
but where do the markets come in if you can&#8217;t get at them?
What is it that&#8217;s binding London over the breadth of Canada
with China and Japan&mdash;only the level steel road.
You said, &#8216;We&#8217;ve gold and silver and timber, but we&#8217;re
wanting bread, machines, and men.&#8217; We said, &#8216;We&#8217;ll send
the locomotives; it will bring you them;&#8217; and this railroad
keeps its promise&mdash;keeps it every time. So we cut down
the forest, and we blew up the mighty rocks, we drove a
smooth pathway through the heart of the ranges&mdash;and
now its your part to fill the freight cars to the bursting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll bring you good men in legions; we&#8217;ll take out
your high-grade ore, but you&#8217;ll remember that the building
of this railroad wasn&#8217;t all luxury. Some of those who laid
the ties sleep soundly beside them, some lost their money,
and now when you have thanked the leaders in Ottawa,
Montreal, and Victoria, there are others to whom your
thanks are due&mdash;the men who stayed right there with their
contracts in spite of fire and snow, staking dollar after dollar
on a terribly risky game. There were considerable of them,
but most of you know this one&mdash;I&#8217;m sharing my laurels
with him&mdash;&#8221; and as a thunder of applause which followed
the halt he made died away he turned toward me. &#8220;Stand
right up, Contractor Lorimer&mdash;they&#8217;re shouting for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was further clamor, but I scarcely heard it, and
I longed that the floor of the hall might open beneath me.
Still, there was clearly no escape, and I stood up under the
lamplight, noticing, as one often notices trifles at such times,
how like a navvy&#8217;s my right hand was as it trembled a little
on the white tablecloth. A sea of faces were turned toward
me expectantly, and I pitied their owners&#8217; disappointment,
but I saw only four persons plainly&mdash;my uncle, and
Alice, who flashed an encouraging glance at me, Colonel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Carrington looking up with a semi-ironical smile, and Grace.
I could not tell what her expression meant.</p>
<p>I should sooner have faced a forest fire than that assembly,
but at least my remarks were brief, and I felt on firmer
ground when memories of the rock-barred track and the
lonely camps rose up before me, and there was a shout at
the lame conclusion, &#8220;We gave our bond and we tried to
keep it, as the rest did too. We were poor men, all of us,
and we are poor men still; but every one owes something to
the land that gives him bread. So we tried to pay back a
little, and perhaps we failed; but at least the road is made,
and we look forward hoping that a full tide of prosperity
will flow into this country along the rails we laid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The applause swelled and deepened when Harry Lorraine
stood up, silver-tongued, graceful, smiling, and called
forth roars of laughter by his happy wit; and when he had
finished Martin Lorimer, who was red in the face, stretched
his arm across the table toward me, and held up a goblet,
saying: &#8220;For the honor of the old country! Well done,
both of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fun is nearly over. We can talk business,&#8221; said
the gray-haired man from Winnipeg, on my right side. &#8220;I
may say that we are satisfied with the way you have served
us, and, though a bargain is a bargain, we don&#8217;t wish to
take an unfair advantage of any one; so the surveyor will
meet you over the extras. He is waiting with the schedule,
and by his advice we&#8217;re open to let you this contract for
hewn lumber supplies. Here&#8217;s a rough memo; the quantity
is large, and that is our idea of a reasonable figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>I glanced at the paper with open pleasure, but the other
checked me as I began to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you will take it! It&#8217;s a commercial transaction,
and not a matter of thanks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Settle details with
the surveyor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>I spent some time with the latter, who smiled dryly as
he said, &#8220;Not quite cleaned out yet? Well, it&#8217;s seldom
wise to be too previous, and you can&#8217;t well come to grief
over the new deal. Wanted again, confound them! Sail
in and prosper, Lorimer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left a payment order which somewhat surprised me,
and when I stood under the stars wondering whether all
that had happened was not too good to be true, Harry came
up in search of me. I grabbed him by the shoulder and shook
the paper before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our friend has acted more than fairly,&#8221; I said. &#8220;We
can pay off all debts, and I have just concluded a big new,
profitable deal!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will keep,&#8221; said Harry, laughing; &#8220;another matter
won&#8217;t. They&#8217;re going to haul out the visitors&#8217; picnic
straight away, and they show good judgment. A sleeper
on the main line will form a much more peaceful resting-place
than this elated hamlet to-night. Your uncle wants
to see you, and Miss Carrington is waiting beside the cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found Alice and Martin Lorimer beside the track, the
latter fuming impatiently, while the locomotive bell summoned
the passengers; and as I joined them Grace walked
into the group before she recognized us. Alice was the
first to speak, and I saw the two faces plainly under the
lighted car windows, as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to meet you again, Miss Carrington, and am
sorry I missed you this afternoon. I was too busy giving my
cousin good advice&mdash;it&#8217;s a privilege I have enjoyed from
childhood&mdash;to recognize you at first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace&#8217;s expression changed, and I thanked Alice in my
heart for what I believe few women would have done.
Then there was a shriek of the whistle, and a bustle about
the train; and as Grace moved toward the car she said
softly in passing:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was a fitting consummation. Better times are coming,
Ralph, and I am proud of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I never to speak to thee, lad?&#8221; said Martin.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing would please me better than to wait and
see the fun out; but Alice, she won&#8217;t hear of it. Come
to see us, and stay a month if you can. Anyway, come to-morrow
or the day after. I have lots to tell thee. Oh,
hang them! they&#8217;re starting. Alice, wouldn&#8217;t that lady take
charge of thee while I stay back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get into the car, father,&#8221; said the girl, with a laugh.
&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t forget you&#8217;re the people&#8217;s warden. Good-bye,
Ralph, until we see you at the chalet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; called a loud voice; the couplings tightened;
and I waved my hat as, followed by a last cheer, the
train rolled away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true that all has been settled satisfactorily?&#8221; asked
Harry, presently, and when I answered, he added: &#8220;Then
we&#8217;re going back to finish the evening. Johnston&#8217;s to honor
the company with stump speeches and all kinds of banjo eccentricities.
You are getting too sober and serious, Ralph;
come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>I refused laughingly, and spent at least an hour walking
up and down through the cool dimness that hung over the
track to dissipate the excitement of a day of varied emotions.
Then I went back to our shanty and slept soundly, until
about daybreak I was partly wakened by the feasters returning
with discordant songs, though I promptly went to
sleep again. I never heard exactly what happened in the
wooden town that night, but there was wreckage in its
streets the next morning, and when I opened my eyes the
first thing I saw was our partner Johnston slumbering peacefully
with his head among the fragments of his shattered
banjo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A GENEROUS OFFER</h3>
</div>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the next day when Harry
and I sat figuring in our shanty, while Johnston lay on
a heap of cedar twigs sucking at his pipe and encouraging us
languidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never could stand figures, and that&#8217;s perhaps why I&#8217;m
poor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Go on, you are doing famously, and,
though Ralph can&#8217;t add up correctly to save his life, I&#8217;ll
take your word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He formed a characteristic picture of the free lance as he
lay there, bronzed and blonde-bearded, with his massy limbs
disposed in an attitude of easy grace, awaiting the result with
a careless unconcern until Harry flung a long boot at him as
a signal for silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the surveyor told you, Ralph, we can&#8217;t well lose
money on this last venture, even if we wanted to,&#8221; said
Harry at length. &#8220;You&#8217;ll observe I&#8217;m almost getting superstitious.
Now, on cashing the order, we can repay your
loan, keeping back sufficient to meet emergencies, while with
the rest one of us could return to Fairmead and plough every
available acre for next spring&#8217;s sowing. Many things suggest
that you are the one to go. Johnston and I with the
others could get the timber out during the winter&mdash;we have
worked in the snow before&mdash;and I would join you in the
spring. That, however, again raises a point that must be
settled once for all. Are we to hold on to our first ambition,
or turn contractors?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>Again there was a silence through which the roar of the
river reached us brokenly, and for some minutes I breathed
the smell of hot dust and resinous twigs that entered the
open doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hold on to the first,&#8221; I said finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I stand by you,&#8221; answered Harry.</p>
<p>Simultaneously we glanced at Johnston, who looked up
with the same gay indifference he had manifested when we
floundered half-fed, knee-deep in slush of snow. &#8220;I&#8217;ll save
you unpleasant explanations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a stormy petrel,
and the monotonous life of a farmer would pall on me, so
I&#8217;ll see you through the railroad contract, and then&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ll thank you for a space of pleasant comradeship, and go
on my way again. The mountain province is sufficiently
good for me, and some day I&#8217;ll find either a gold mine in
it, or, more likely, a grave. If not, you can count on a visit
whenever I am hard up and hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were typical of the man, though their undercurrent
of melancholy troubled me; but, for we knew he
spoke the truth in regard to the farming, the matter was
settled so. I should much have preferred that Harry return
to Fairmead, but it was clear that the task most suited
me. Perhaps Johnston guessed my reluctance, for he said
playfully: &#8220;Is not banishment worse than snow slides or
the high peak&#8217;s frost, and what are all the flowers of the
prairie to the blood-red rose of the valley that was grafted
from Lancastrian stock?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Harry deftly dropped an almost-empty flour
bag on his head, and the consultation broke up amid a cloud
of white dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; remarked Johnston, &#8220;is the beginning of riches.
Two days ago, he would have carefully swept up the fragments
to make flapjacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it came about that the next morning I boarded the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
main line express, and traveled first-class with a special
pass, while as luck would have it the conductor, who evinced
an unusual civility when he glanced at the autograph thereon,
was the same man I had worsted the memorable night when
I arrived a penniless stranger on the prairie. &#8220;If you want
anything in these cars, just let me know,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; I answered, thrusting back the wide-brimmed
hat as I looked at him. &#8220;The last time we traveled together
you were not so accommodating. We had a little
dispute at Elktail one night in the snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;General Jackson!&#8221; exclaimed the conductor. &#8220;But you
didn&#8217;t travel with that name on your ticket then. Say, it
was all a mistake and in the way of business. You won&#8217;t
bear malice?&#8221;</p>
<p>He vanished without awaiting an answer, and I leaned
back on the cushions chuckling softly, after which, fishing
out my pipe, I sank into a soothing reverie. There was no
doubt that this kind of traveling had its advantages, and it
appeared equally certain that I had earned a few days&#8217; luxurious
holiday, while, as the blue wreaths curled up, the
towering pines outside the windows changed into the gaunt
chimneys of smoky Lancashire. Then they dwindled to
wind-dwarfed birches, and I was lashing the frantic broncos
as they raced the hail for the shelter of a bluff, until once
more it seemed to be autumn and a breadth of yellow wheat
stood high above the prairie, while the rhythmic beat of
wheels changed to the rattle of the elevators lifting in the
golden grain. Here, however, roused by a scream of the
whistle as the long train swept by a little station, I found
that the pipe lay among feathery ashes on my knee, and an
hour had passed, while I knew that under the touch of sleep
my thoughts had turned mechanically into the old channel.</p>
<p>It was toward noon when I left the cars at a station
looking down upon a broad reach of sunlit river which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
wound past maples, willows, and a few clearings through a
deep valley. Martin Lorimer and Alice met me on the
platform, and his greeting was hearty.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have watched every train since we last saw you,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Alice, though she won&#8217;t own it, has been anxious,
too. Never spent such an interesting time as I did up
yonder, and we&#8217;re going to make it pleasant for you here.
Of course, you&#8217;ll stay with us a week or two?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s face fell as I answered that time was pressing,
and I must return the following day, while for some
reason Alice turned her face aside, but she laughed pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your uncle has been talking of nothing else the last two
days,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am glad I did not leave him with those
wild men in the rejoicing city. Some of them, however,
seemed very nice. Meanwhile, I think lunch is waiting for
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>We reached the pretty chalet hotel, which was hardly
completed then, though it is a famous resort now, and it
was a new experience, after faring hardly on doughy flapjacks
and reistit pork of our own cooking, to sit at a well-ordered
table covered with spotless linen. Still better did it
seem to see Alice smiling upon me across the flowers in the
glasses and sparkling silver, and Martin Lorimer&#8217;s cheery
face as, while he pressed the good things upon me, we
chatted of old times and England. It is only through adversity
and hardship that one learns to appreciate fully such
an interlude.</p>
<p>My uncle had, however, not yet recovered his strength,
and when later his eyes grew heavy Alice whispered that
he usually slept in the heat of the afternoon, and I was glad
to follow her into a garden newly hewn out of the forest.
We sat there in scented shadow under the branches of giant
redwoods, with the song of rippling water in our ears, and I
remember taking Alice into my confidence about the mysterious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
loan. She listened with interest, and once more I
noticed how ill she looked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have more good friends than you think, Ralph; and
it was of service to you, was it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered with emphasis. &#8220;Of the greatest
service! Perhaps it saved us from ruin, but at first I almost
decided not to touch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice laughed, a clear laugh that mingled musically with
the call of a wood pigeon in the green dimness above.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need hardly tell me that&mdash;all great men have their
weaknesses; but seriously, Ralph, don&#8217;t you think if the good
friend desired to keep it a secret it is hardly fair to try to
find him out? No, from what you tell me, I hardly think
you will unravel the mystery while the donor&mdash;lender, I
mean&mdash;lives. Besides, even if you never do, you can repay
it by assisting some hard-pressed comrade in distress.
Yes, I should fancy the person who lent it would prefer that
way. However, I want to tell you about your sister Aline.
She has grown into a handsome young woman, too handsome
almost to fight her own way unprotected in the world, but
she is like yourself in some respects, and will neither live with
us nor let your uncle help her. She is teaching now&mdash;do
you know what women are paid for teaching in some private
schools? And I don&#8217;t think she is happy. The last time I
saw her I almost cried afterward, though she would only tell
me that she was choking for sunlight and air. Even her
dress was worn and shabby. Ralph, you know how old
friends we are, and I have been wondering&mdash;you really must
be sensible&mdash;whether I could help her through you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Something stung me to the quick, and I clenched one
hand savagely, for in the grim uphill battle I had nearly forgotten
Aline. It was so long since I had seen her, and when
each day&#8217;s hard work was done we were almost too tired to
think. Still, my brow was crimson with shame when I remembered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
that my sister went, it might be, scantily fed,
while what plans I made were all for my own future and
Grace.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my part,&#8221; I answered hotly. &#8220;She should have
written frankly to her brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice stopped me. &#8220;You do not understand women,
Ralph, and she knew that you too were struggling. Neither
do I see how you can help her now, and it would be a favor
to me. It is beyond the power of any vigorous man with a
task for every moment to realize what it means to sit still
weak and helpless and know that even wealth cannot bring
respite from constant pain. Active pleasure, work and health
have been denied me by fate, and my life cannot be a long
one. It may be very short, though your uncle will not allow
himself to believe it, and I long to do a little good while I
can. Ralph, won&#8217;t you help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a shock, I realized that she spoke only the plain
truth. Indeed, her thin eager face contracted then, and
ever afterward I was glad that moved by some impulse I
stooped and reverently kissed the fragile hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were always somebody&#8217;s good angel, cousin,&#8221; I said;
&#8220;but I am her brother, and this time I can help. I am going
back to the farm at Fairmead, and, if she is longing for
open air, do you think she would come and keep house for
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice blushed as she drew away the white fingers, but
she showed her practical bent by a cross-examination, and
eventually she agreed that though there were objections the
plan might be feasible.</p>
<p>&#8220;You write to her by the next mail,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I
will write too&mdash;no, it would be better if I waited a little.
Why? You must trust my discretion&mdash;even your great
mind cannot grasp everything. Now I want you to tell me
all about Miss Carrington.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>Alice had a way with her that unlocked the secrets of
many hearts, and the shadows had lengthened across the
lawn before the narrative was finished. I can still picture
her lying back on the lounge with hands clasped before her,
a line of pain on her brow, and the humming birds flashing
athwart the blossoms of the arrowhead that drooped above
her. Then, glancing straight before her toward the ethereal
snows, she said with a sigh:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see trouble in store for both of you, but I envy her.
She has health and strength, and a purpose to help her to
endure. Ralph, there is always an end to our trials if one
can wait for it, and you both have something to wait for.
Hold fast, and I think you will win her&mdash;and you know
who will wish you the utmost happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently we went down together to the boulders of the
river, and watched the steelhead salmon pass on in shadowy
battalions as they forced their way inland against the green-stained
current, while Alice, whose store of general knowledge
was surprising, said meditatively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Theirs is a weary journey inland from the sea, over
shoal, against white rapid, and over spouting fall, toward
the hidden valleys among the glaciers&mdash;and most of them
die, don&#8217;t they, when they get there? There&#8217;s a symbol of
life for you, but I sometimes think that, whether it&#8217;s men or
salmon, the fighters have the best of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked of birds and fishes, and of many other things,
while once a big blue grouse perched on a fir bough and
looked down fearlessly within reach of her, though when
the wrinkles of pain had vanished Alice seemed happy to sit
still in the warm sunshine speaking of nothing at all. Still,
even in the silence, the bond of friendship between us was
drawn tighter than it ever had been, and I knew that I felt
better and stronger for my cousin&#8217;s company.</p>
<p>It was some time after dinner, and the woods were darkening,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
when Martin Lorimer and I sat together on the
carved veranda. There was wine on the table before us,
and the old man raised his glass somewhat hurriedly, though
his face betokened unmistakable surprise when again I mentioned
the loan. Then he lit a very choice cigar, and when
I had done the same he leaned forward looking at me through
the smoke, as changing by degrees into the speech of the spinning
country, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll listen and heed well, Ralph. You went out to
Canada against my will, lad, and I bided my time. &#8216;He&#8217;ll
either be badly beaten or win his footing there, and either
will do him good,&#8217; I said. If you had been beaten I should
have seen to it that my only brother&#8217;s son should never go
wanting. Nay, wait &#8217;til I have finished, but it would
not have been the same. I had never a soft side for the
beaten weakling, and I&#8217;m glad I bided. Now, when you&#8217;ve
proved yourself what Tom&#8217;s son should be, this is what I
offer thee. There&#8217;s the mill; I&#8217;m old and done, and while
there&#8217;s one of the old stock forward I would not turn it over
to be moiled and muddled by a limited company. Saving,
starving, scheming, I built it bit by bit, and to-day there&#8217;s
no cotton spun in Lancashire to beat the Orb brand.
There&#8217;ll be plenty of good men under thee, and I&#8217;m waiting
to make thee acting partner. Ay, it&#8217;s old and done I&#8217;m
growing, and, Ralph Lorimer, I&#8217;m telling thee what none
but her ever guessed before&mdash;I would have sold my soul for
a kind word from thy mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a time, almost bewildered by the splendid offer, I
stared blankly into the eddying smoke, while my thoughts
refused to concentrate themselves, and I first wondered why
he had made it to me. Now I know it was partly due to
the staunch pride of race and family that once held the
yeomen of the dales together in foray and feud, and partly
to a fondness for myself that I had never wholly realized.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
Then it became apparent that I could not accept it. Grace
would pine in smoke-blackened Lancashire, as she had told
me, and I knew that the life of mill and office would grow intolerable,
while the man who acted as Martin Lorimer&#8217;s
partner would have small respite from it. There was Harry
also, who had linked his future with my great project. But
the offer was tempting after the constant financial pressure,
and for another minute the words failed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am awaiting thy answer, lad,&#8221; said Martin Lorimer.</p>
<p>Then I stood up before him as I said slowly: &#8220;You are
generous, uncle&mdash;more than generous, and it grieves me
that the answer can only be&mdash;no. Give me a few moments
to explain why this must be so. I could never settle down
to the shut-in life; and half-hearted work would only be
robbery. You would demand his best from your partner,
wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should; brain and body,&#8221; said the old man, grimly
watching me with hawk-like eyes, for there was a steely
underside to his character.</p>
<p>I leaned one elbow on the back of a chair as I continued:
&#8220;I could not give it. Besides, I have set my heart on winning
my own fortune out of the prairie&mdash;I am in honor
bound to my partner Lorraine in this, and&mdash;I can never
leave Canada until the lady I hope to marry some day goes
with me. You saw her at the opening ceremony&mdash;Miss
Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Lorimer smote the table, which, when excited,
was a favorite trick of his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy wife!&#8221; he said stupidly. &#8220;Art pledged to marry
Miss Carrington of all women, lad? And does she care
for thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust so,&#8221; I answered slowly, as I watched the frown
deepen on the old man&#8217;s face. I dreaded the next question,
which came promptly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what does the iron-fisted Colonel say as to thee for
a son-in-law?&#8221;</p>
<p>It took me at least five minutes to explain, and I felt my
anomalous position keenly during the process, while, when
the story was finished, Martin Lorimer laughed a harsh dry
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, thou&#8217;rt rash and headstrong and a condemned
fool besides,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thee would never have made a
partner in the Orb mill. Thou&#8217;rt Tom&#8217;s bairn all through,
but I like thy spirit. Stand up there, straight and steady,
so, while I look at thee. Never a son of my own, lad;
thou&#8217;rt the last of the Lingdale folk, and I had set my heart
on thee. Ay, I&#8217;m the successful spinner, and I paid for my
success. It&#8217;s hard to keep one&#8217;s hands clean and be first in
the business; but there&#8217;s no one better knows the sign; and
travel, and maybe Miss Carrington, has put that sign on
thee. Once I hoped&mdash;it&#8217;s past and done with, I&#8217;m foolish
as well as old; but as that can never be, I&#8217;m only wishing
the best of luck to thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gulped down a glass of the red wine and wiped his
forehead, while his voice had a hard note in it as he continued:
&#8220;Her father&#8217;s a man of iron, but there&#8217;s iron, too,
in thee. I had my part in the people&#8217;s struggle when Lancashire
led the way, and then after a trick at the election I
hated him and all his kind. I&#8217;ve a better reason since for
hating him. We can beat them in brain and muscle, our
courage is as good as theirs, and yet, if you weld the two
kinds together, there&#8217;s not their equal in the world. He&#8217;s
proud of his robber forbears, but there was one of thine
drew a good bow with the archers at Crecy. Ralph, thy
news has stirred me into vaporing, and the man who built
the Orb mill is prating like a child. Ay, I&#8217;m grieved to
the heart&mdash;and I&#8217;m glad. Fill up thy glass to the brim,
lad&mdash;here&#8217;s God bless her and thee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>There followed a clink of glasses, and some of the wine
was spilt. I could see the red drops widen on the snowy
tablecloth, and then Martin Lorimer gripped my hand in a
manner that showed no traces of senile decay, saying somewhat
huskily as he turned away:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want time to think it over, but I&#8217;ll tell thee this. Hold
fast with both hands to thy purpose, take the thrashings&mdash;and
wait, and if ever thou&#8217;rt hard pressed, with thy back
right on the wall, thou&#8217;lt remember Martin Lorimer&mdash;or
damn thy mulishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gave me the same advice all round, and perhaps it
was as well, for of all the hard things that fall to the lot
of the man who strives with his eyes turned forward the
hardest is to wait. Still, it was something to have won
Martin Lorimer&#8217;s approval, for I had hitherto found him an
unsympathetic and critical man, who bore in his person traces
of the battle he had fought. There were those who called
him lucky; but these had lain softly and fared well while
he starved and wrought, winning his way by inches until he
built up out of nothing the splendid trade of the Orb mill.</p>
<p>None of us was talkative that evening, but fervent good
wishes followed me when I went out with the east-bound
train the next day, and until the dusky pines hid her, closing
round the track, I saw cousin Alice&#8217;s slight figure with her
face turned toward the departing train.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE RETURN TO THE PRAIRIE</h3>
</div>

<p>We were busy during the two days that followed my return,
for there was much to be arranged; but at last
all was settled satisfactorily. The surveyor had obtained me
free transport back to the prairie for two teams that would not
be needed, and Harry had promised to take charge of operations
in my place. He was young for the position, or would
have been considered so in England, but across the Atlantic
much of the hard work is done by very young men, and I
could trust his discretion, so only one thing remained to prevent
my immediate return to Fairmead. I must see Grace
before I went, and after considering the subject at length
I determined to ride boldly up to the Colonel&#8217;s ranch and
demand an interview. Even if this were refused me I
should not be worse off than before, and I had found that
often in times of uncertainty fortune follows the boldest
move.</p>
<p>I rode out under the starlight from our camp, for if
all went well I hoped to turn my back on the mountain
province by sunset, and if Harry guessed how I proposed to
spend the interval he made no direct reference, though he
said with unusual emphasis at parting, &#8220;I wish you good
luck, Ralph&mdash;in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll second that,&#8221; added Johnston, wringing my hand as
I bent down from the saddle, for they had walked beside me
down the trail; then I shook the bridle and they vanished
into the gloom behind. It may have been mere coincidence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
or a conceit of Johnston&#8217;s playful fancy, for when I dipped
into the valley his voice came ringing after me, &#8220;Oh, who
will o&#8217;er the downs so free! Oh, who will with me ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>The next line or two was lost in a clatter of hoofs on
shingle, and then once more the words rose clearly above the
dewy pines, &#8220;To win a blooming bride!&#8221; More of the
ballad followed, for Johnston trolled it lustily as he strode
back to the shanty, and the refrain haunted me as I swept
on through the cool dimness under the conifers, for the lilt
of it went fittingly with the clang of iron on quartz outcrop
and the jingle of steel. It also chimed with my own
thoughts the while, and the last lines broke from my lips
triumphantly when we raced out of the dusky woods into
the growing light under a giant rampart of mountains, behind
whose peaks a red flush broadened in the east. The
mists rolled back like a curtain, the shadows fled, and the
snow, throwing off its deathly pallor, put on splendors of
incandescence to greet the returning day. Nowhere does
dawn come more grandly than in that ice-ribbed wilderness
of crag and forest; but as I watched it then I accepted the
wondrous spectacle merely as an augury of brighter days for
Grace and myself, and for a last time the ballad echoed
across the silent bush as I drove the good horse splashing
through a ford.</p>
<p>It was afternoon when, much more sedately, for the
beast was tired and I had misgivings now, we splashed
through another river into sight of Colonel Carrington&#8217;s
dwelling, whose shingled roof was faintly visible among the
pines ahead; while once more it seemed that fortune or
destiny had been kind to me. A white dress moved slowly
among the rough-barked trunks, and because a thick carpet
of withered needles deadened the sound of hoofs I came
almost upon Grace before she saw me. She was gazing
at the ground; the long lashes hid her eyes, but I fancied that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
a suspicious moisture glistened under them, and there was
trouble stamped on her face. Then as I swung myself from
the saddle she ran toward me with a startled cry and stopped
irresolutely. But I had my arms about her even as she
turned half-away, and I said eagerly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has happened, sweetheart. You must tell me
what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed, and, trembling a little, clung more tightly
to my arm when, after tethering the horse, we walked slowly
side by side through the shadow of the great fir branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was longing for you so,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As you say, something
has happened, and there is no one to whom I can tell
my troubles. What I feared has happened, for this morning
Geoffrey Ormond asked me to marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confusion to him!&#8221; I broke out, driving one heel deep
into the fir needles; and when Grace checked me, laying
both hands on her shoulders, I held her fast as I asked,
&#8220;And what did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled faintly as she answered, &#8220;This is not the age
of savagery, Ralph; your fingers are bruising me. What
answer could I give him after my promise to you? I said,
&#8216;No.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the folly is done with, and there will be an end
to his presumption,&#8221; I answered hotly. But Grace sighed
again as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, this is not the ending. You are fierce and stubborn
and headstrong&mdash;and I like to have you so; Geoffrey
is cool and quiet and slow, and, I must say it, a chivalrous
gentleman. I could not tell him all; but he took my answer
gracefully, saying he would respect it in the meantime, but
would never give up hope. Ralph, I almost wonder whether
you would have acted as becomingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was said to gain time; and, if so, I took the
bait and answered with bitterness:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He has been trained and polished and accustomed to the
smooth side of life. Is it strange that he has learned a little
courtesy? Again I say, confound him! I am of the people,
stained with the soil, and roughened by a laborer&#8217;s toil; but,
Grace, you know I would gladly give my life to serve you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are as God and your work have made you,&#8221; was
the quiet answer; and, drawing closer to me, she added,
&#8220;And I would not have you otherwise. Don&#8217;t lapse into
heroics, Ralph. What you did that day in the ca√±on will
speak better than words for you. Instead you must listen
while I tell you the whole story. As it was with you and
your cousin, Geoffrey and I&mdash;we are distantly related
too&mdash;were always good friends. He was older, and, as you
say, polished, and in many ways I looked up to him, while
my father was trustee for him under a will, and when he
joined the army my father continued, I understand, to manage
his property. Still&mdash;and I know now that I must have
been blind&mdash;I never looked upon Geoffrey as&mdash;as a possible
husband until twelve months ago. Since then my eyes
have been opened, and I understand many things&mdash;most
of all that my father wished it, for he has told me so, and
that Geoffrey is heavily interested financially in his ventures.
I know that he has sunk large sums of money in the mine,
and they have found no ore, while I heard a chance whisper
of a mortgage on Carrington. Yet Geoffrey has never even
hinted to me that he was more than a small shareholder.
My father has grown aged and worn lately, though only
those who know him well could tell he was carrying a heavy
load of anxiety. He has always been kind to me, and it hurt,
horribly, to refuse to meet his wishes when he almost
pleaded with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scent of summer seemed to have faded out of the
air, the golden rays that beat in between the great trunks
lost their brightness, and only one way of escape from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
situation presented itself to me as again the refrain of the
ballad jingled through my memory. It was also a way that
suited me. If Grace and I could not be married with the
Colonel&#8217;s consent, we could without it; and I thanked Providence
that she need suffer no actual hardships at Fairmead
now, while with her advice and encouragement the future
looked brilliant. We could reach the flag station in two
hours if we started at once. And then, with a chill, I remembered
my promise to the Colonel, and that I stood, as it
were, on a parole of honor. Yet a rash promise seemed a
small thing to wreck two lives; and, saying nothing, I set
my teeth tightly as I remembered hearing my father once
say long ago, &#8220;I am thankful that, if we have our failings,
none of us has ever broken a solemn promise.&#8221; Martin
Lorimer too&mdash;and some called him keen, in distinction to
scrupulous&mdash;I remembered, accepted a draft he had been
clearly tricked into signing, and duly met it at maturity,
though, when the affair was almost forgotten, he made the
man who drew it suffer. And so the inward struggle went
on, until there were beads of perspiration on my forehead
and Grace said, &#8220;Ralph, you look deathly. Are you ill?&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not answer, and was afterward thankful that
perhaps fate intervened to save me, for I almost felt that
Grace would have yielded to pressure then. There were
footsteps in the forest, and, as instinctively we drew back
behind a fir, Colonel Carrington walked savagely down an
open glade. He passed close to us, and, believing himself
alone in that solitude, had thrown off the mask. His face
was drawn and haggard, his hands were clenched, and for
once I read fear of something in his eyes; while Grace
trembled again as she watched him, and neither of us spoke
until he vanished among the firs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;twice I have seen him so when
he did not know it. Perhaps it was meant that this should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
happen, for now I know that even were there no other
obstacle I could not leave him. Sweetheart, could you expect
the full duty to her husband from the woman who had
signally failed in her duty to others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered with a groan. &#8220;But is there no hope
in the present?&mdash;nothing that I can do?&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew my face down toward her as she answered,
&#8220;Only work and wait, sweetheart,&#8221; and her voice sank to a
low whisper. &#8220;Heaven forgive me if I wrong him in telling
you. But there are no secrets between us, and you saw his
face. I fear that inadvertently he has lost much of Geoffrey&#8217;s
money in rash ventures, as well as his own. Geoffrey would
never trouble about finance, and insisted on leaving his property
in his hands, while, though my father is fond of speculation
and control, I am afraid he is a poor business man.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shivered all through, and said nothing for a few moments,
while I tried to soothe her; then she added slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I must stand beside him in this trouble; and if the worst
comes I do not ask you to leave me&mdash;it would be wrong and
foolish, and I know you too well. But, though I have read
how many women have done such things, I will never marry
Geoffrey. It would be a crime to myself and to him, and
he is far too good for such treatment. Sweetheart, I must
leave you, and it may be so very long before we meet again;
but I hope brighter days will dawn for us yet. You will
help me to do what I ought, dearest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later I rode through the woods at a breakneck
gallop, reviling fate and all things incoherently, until,
as the horse reeled down an incline amid a mad clatter of
sliding shale, Ormond, of all men, must come striding up
the trail with an air of tranquil calm about him. There is
a certain spice of barbarism, I suppose, in most of us, and
in my frame of mind the mere sight of his untroubled
face filled me with bitterness. It seemed that, in spite of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
her refusal, he felt sure of Grace; and something suggested
that a trail hewn at Government expense was free to the
wealthy well-born and the toiler alike, and I would not
swerve a foot to give him passage. So only a quick spring
saved him from being ridden down, while I laughed harshly
over my shoulder when his voice followed me: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you look ahead, confound you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was possibly well that I had trouble with the teams
in the stock car on the railroad journey, and that work in
plenty awaited at Fairmead, for the steady tramp behind the
plough stilts served to steady me. After three weeks&#8217;
endurance, the man I had hired to help mutinied, and stated
plainly that he had no intention of either wearing himself to
skin and bone or unmercifully overworking dumb cattle, but
I found satisfaction in toiling on alone, often until after the
lingering darkness fell, for each fathom of rich black clod
added to the long furrow seemed to lessen the distance that
divided me from Grace. Then little by little a measure of
cheerfulness returned, for sun, wind, and night dew had
blended their healing with the smell of newly-turned earth,
a smell I loved on the prairie, for it told that the plough had
opened another channel into treasure locked fast for countless
ages. So hope was springing up again when I waited
one morning with my wagon beside the railroad track to
welcome my sister Aline.</p>
<p>I could scarcely believe my eyes when she stepped down
from the car platform, for the somewhat gawky maiden, as
I used to term her in our not altogether infrequent playful
differences of opinion, when similar compliments were
common, had grown into a handsome woman, fair-skinned,
but ruddy of color, as all of us were, and I was embarrassed
when to the envy of the loungers she embraced me effusively.
The drive home across the prairie was a wonder to her, and
it touched me to notice how she rejoiced in its breadth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
freedom, for the returning luster in her eyes and the somewhat
too hollow face told their own tale of adversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all so splendid,&#8221; she said vaguely. &#8220;A poor
lunch, you say; it is ever and ever so much better than my
usual daily fare,&#8221; and her voice had a vibration that suggested
tearfulness. &#8220;This is almost too good to be true!
I have always loved the open space and sun, and for two
weary years I lived in a dismal room of a dismal house in a
particularly dismal street, where there was nothing but mud
and smoke, half-paid work, and sickening drudgery. Ralph,
I should ten times over sooner wash milk-pans or drive cattle
in a sunlit land like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>I laughed approvingly as she ceased for want of breath,
realizing that Aline had much in common with myself; while
the rest of the journey passed very cheerfully, and her
face was eager with curiosity when I handed her down at
the house. She looked around our living room with disdainful
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is comfortable enough, but, Ralph, did you ever
brush it? I have never seen any place half so dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had not noticed the fact before. Indeed, under
pressure of work we had usually dispensed with small
comforts, superfluous cleanliness I fear among them, and
Fairmead was certainly very dirty, though it probably differed
but little from most bachelors&#8217; quarters in that region. The
stove-baked clods of the previous ploughing still littered the
floor; the dust that was thick everywhere doubtless came in
with our last thrashing; and the dishes I had used during the
last few weeks reposed unwashed among it. But Aline
was clearly a woman of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shockingly untidy man!&#8221; she said severely.
&#8220;Carry my trunk into my room, quick. I am going to put
on an old dress, and make you help me clean up first thing.
Tired?&mdash;after lounging on soft cushions&mdash;when I tramped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
miles of muddy streets carrying heavy books every day. You
won&#8217;t get out of it that way. Go away, and bring me
some water&mdash;bring lots of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I came back from the well, with a filled cask in
the wagon, she had already put on a calico wrapper and
both doors and windows were open wide, and I hardly recognized
the dwelling when we had finished what Aline said
was only the first stage of the proceedings. Then I lighted
the stove, and, returning after stabling the horses, found her
waiting at the head of a neatly-set table covered with a
clean white cloth, which she had doubtless brought with
her, for such things were not included in the Fairmead inventory.
The house seemed brighter for her presence,
though I sighed as I pictured Grace in her place, and then
reflected that many things must be added before Fairmead
was fit for Grace. I had begun to learn a useful lesson
in practical details. Aline noticed the sigh, and plied me
with questions, until when, for the nights were getting
chilly, we sat beside the twinkling stove, I told her as much
as I thought it was desirable that she should know. Aline
was two years my junior, and I had no great confidence as
yet in her wisdom.</p>
<p>She listened with close attention, and then said meditatively:
&#8220;I hope that some day you will be happy. No, never
mind explaining that you must be&mdash;marriage is a great
lottery. But why, you foolish boy, must you fall in love
with the daughter of that perfectly awful man! There was
some one so much nicer at home, you know, and I feel sure
she was very fond of you. Alice is a darling, even if she
has not much judgment in such matters. Oh, dear me,
what am I saying now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; I said, startled by an idea that hitherto
had never for a moment occurred to me. &#8220;I beg your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
pardon; but you are only a young girl, Aline. Of course
you must be mistaken, because&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t be so. I am
as poor as a gopher almost, and she is a heiress. Don&#8217;t you
realize that it&#8217;s utterly unbecoming for any one of your
years to talk so lightly of these matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline laughed mischievously. &#8220;Are you so old and
wise already, Ralph?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Brotherly superiority
won&#8217;t go very far with a girl who has earned her own living.
As you say, I should not have told you this, but you must
have been blinder than a mole&mdash;even your uncle saw it, and
I am quite right.&#8221; She looked me over critically before
she continued, as though puzzled: &#8220;I really cannot see why
she should be so, and I begin to fancy that a little plain
speaking will be good for my elder brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>I checked the exclamation just in time, and stared at
her while I struggled with a feeling of shame and dismay.
It was not that I had chosen Grace, but it was borne in
on me forcibly that besides wounding the feelings of the
two persons to whom I owed a heavy debt of gratitude, I
must more than once, in mock heroic fashion, have made
a stupendous fool of myself. Such knowledge was not
pleasant, though perhaps the draught was beneficial, and if
plain speaking of that kind were wholesome there was more
in store, for hardship had not destroyed Aline&#8217;s inquisitorial
curiosity, nor her fondness for comments, which, if winged
with mischief, had truth in them. Thus, to avoid dangerous
subjects, I confined my conversation to my partners and
railroad building.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is really interesting,&#8221; she vouchsafed at length.
&#8220;Ralph, you haven&#8217;t sense enough to understand women;
but axes, horses, and engines, you know thoroughly. I&#8217;m
quite anxious to see this Harry, and wonder whether I
could tame him. Young men are always so proud of themselves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
and one finds amusement in bringing them to a due
sense of their shortcomings, though I am sorry to say they
are not always grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I laughed as I fancied the keen swordplay of
badinage that would follow before she overcame either
Johnston or Harry, if they ever met, and I almost wondered
at her. This slip of a girl&mdash;for after all, she was still
little more&mdash;had faced what must have been with her tastes
a sufficiently trying lot, but it had not abated one jot of her
somewhat caustic natural gaiety, and there was clearly truth
in my partner&#8217;s saying: &#8220;One need not take everything too
seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>When with some misgivings I showed Aline her room
she pointed out several radical defects that needed immediate
remedy, and I left her wondering whether I must add the
vocation of a carpenter to my already onerous task, and
most of that night I lay wide awake thinking of what she
had told me. When I rose early the next morning, however,
my sister was already down and prepared an unusually
good breakfast while I saw to the working beasts, though she
unhesitatingly condemned the whole of the Fairmead domestic
utensils and crockery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am breaking you in gently,&#8221; she said with a patronizing
air. &#8220;You have used those cracked plates since you
came here? Then they have lasted quite long enough, and
you cannot fry either pork or bacon in a frying-pan minus
half the bottom. Before you can bring a wife here you
will need further improvement; yes, ever and ever so
much, and I hope she will be grateful to me for civilizing
you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE STOLEN CATTLE</h3>
</div>

<p>I had broken a further strip of virgin prairie, besides
ploughing, with hired assistance, part of the already cultivated
land, before the Indian summer passed. All day pale
golden sunlight flooded the whitened grass, which sometimes
glittered with frostwork in early morning, while as the
nights grew longer, the wild fowl came down from the
north. Aline took a strange interest in watching them
sail slowly in endless succession across the blue, and would
often sit hidden beside me at twilight among the tall reeds
of the creek until with a lucky shot from the Marlin I
picked up a brant-goose, or, it might be, a mallard which
had rested on its southward journey, somewhat badly
shattered by the rifle ball. Then, when frost bound fast
the sod and ploughing was done, she would ride with me
toward a distant bluff, where I hewed stouter logs than
grew near us for winter fuel. Already she had grown
fuller in shape and brighter in color with the pure prairie
air.</p>
<p>Jasper paid us frequent visits, and seemed to enjoy being
badly defeated in a verbal encounter with Aline, after which
he would confine his talk to cattle-raising, which of late had
commenced to command increased attention on the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is too much a one-crop country. Stake all on
your wheat yield, and when you lose it you&#8217;re busted,&#8221; he
said, soon after my return. &#8220;Now what&#8217;s the matter with
running more cattle? They&#8217;ll feed themselves in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
summer; and isn&#8217;t there hay enough in the sloos if you
want to keep them?&mdash;while one can generally get a good
fall profit in Winnipeg. I&#8217;ve been picking up cheap lots
all year, and if you have any money to spare I&#8217;ll let you in
reasonably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak like an oracle, Mr. Jasper,&#8221; said Aline.
&#8220;My brother is what you might call a single-crop man.
One thing at one time is enough for him. Ralph, why
don&#8217;t you try a deal in cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>The same thing had been running through my own
mind, and the result was that I wrote Harry, who, being
of a speculative disposition, arranged for an interim payment,
and sent me a remittance, which was duly invested in a
joint transaction with Jasper, who had rather over-purchased.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little pressed for payments just now,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Want to hold my wheat, and can&#8217;t afford eight per cent.
interest. The beasts are fattening all the time, and there&#8217;ll
be a high-class demand in Winnipeg presently for shipment
to Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right; and I began to have a respect for Aline&#8217;s
judgment when the papers reported that prices were rising
fast, and stock-salesman firms sent circulars to this effect
into the districts. But, when I conferred with Jasper,
he advised me to hold on. &#8220;The figures are climbing,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and they&#8217;ll reach high-water mark just before the ice
closes direct shipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last the frost commenced in earnest, and I prepared
to settle down for the winter. There were improvements
to be made to the granary, implements, harness, and stables,
in anticipation of the coming year&#8217;s campaign, besides alterations
in the house; for I felt that many things might
happen before next autumn, and I desired that Fairmead
should be more nearly ready if wanted to receive its new
mistress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>Again, however, fate intervened, for, instead of a round
of monotonous work, many stirring events were crowded
into that winter. The first happened, as usual, unexpectedly,
and came nearly ruining our cattle-trade venture.
To understand it satisfactorily it is necessary to commence
the narrative at the beginning.</p>
<p>It was a chilly night after a warm day. I sat beside the
stove mending harness, while Aline criticized the workmanship
and waxed the twine for me. The last mail had brought
good news from Harry, and I felt in unusual spirits as I
passed the awl through the leather, until there was a creak
of wagon wheels outside, followed by a pounding on the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; said Aline. &#8220;We are both tired after our
ride, and I was looking forward to a chance for giving you
good advice, and a cozy evening. Now some one is coming
to upset it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not mistaken, for when I opened the door
a neighbor said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you Mrs. Fletcher. Met
her walking to Fairmead across the prairie. No; I guess
I&#8217;m in a hurry, and won&#8217;t get down.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was with no great feeling of pleasure that I led the
visitor into the house; and it is curious that as I helped her
down from the wagon something should recall Harry&#8217;s warning:
&#8220;That fellow Fletcher will bring more trouble on you
some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had done enough in that direction already, and
though I did not wish Aline to hear the story, I was glad
she was there, for preceding events had taught me caution.
So, making the best of it, I placed a chair beside the stove,
for Minnie Fletcher explained who she was, and then, while
Aline sat still looking at her with an apparent entire
absence of curiosity which in no way deceived me I waited
impatiently. Minnie had not improved since I last saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
her. Her face was thin and anxious, her dress&mdash;and even
in the remoter corners of the prairie this was unusual&mdash;was
torn and shabby, and she twisted her fingers nervously
before she commenced to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had expected to find you alone, Ralph,&#8221; she said;
and though I pitied her, I felt glad that she had been disappointed
in this respect. &#8220;However, I must tell you;
and it may be a warning to your sister. Tom has fallen
into bad ways again. He is my husband, Miss Lorimer,
and I am afraid not a very good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not turn Aline out on the prairie, and could
only answer, &#8220;I am very sorry. Please go on,&#8221; though it
would have relieved me to make my own comments on
the general conduct of Thomas Fletcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not all his fault,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The boys would
give him whisky to tell them stories when he went to
Brandon for the creamery, and at last he went there continually.
He fell in with some men from Winnipeg who
lent him money, and I think they gambled in town-lots, for
Tom took the little I had saved, and used to come home
rambling about a fortune. Then he would stay away for
days together, until they dismissed him from the creamery,
and all summer he had never a dollar to give me. But I
worked at the butter-packing and managed to feed him
when he did come home, until&mdash;Miss Lorimer, I am sorry
you must hear this&mdash;he used to beat me when I had no
more money to give him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline looked at her with a pity that was mingled with
scorn: &#8220;I have heard of such things, and I have seen them
too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But why did you let him? I think I
should kill the man who struck me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minnie sighed wearily. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, and I
hope you never will. Ralph, I have tried to bear it,
but the life is killing me, and I have grown horribly afraid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
of him. Moran, a friend of the creamery manager, offered
me a place at another station down the line, but I have no
money to get there and I cannot go like this. Tom is coming
back to-night, and I dare not tell him, so I wondered
whether you would help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he will,&#8221; said Aline, &#8220;and if your husband
comes here making inquiries I hope I shall have an opportunity
for answering him.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had the strongest disinclination to be mixed up in such
an affair, but I could see no escape from it. There were
even marks of bruises on the poor woman&#8217;s face, and when,
promising assistance, I went out to see to the horses and
think it over, Minnie Fletcher burst into hysterical sobbing
as Aline placed an arm protectingly around her. She had
retired before I returned, for I fancied that Aline could dispense
with my presence and I found something to detain me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, you are a genius,&#8221; Aline said when I told her
that I did not hurry back, &#8220;I have arranged to lend her
enough to buy a few things, and to-morrow I&#8217;m going to
drive her in to the store and the station. No, you need
not come; I know the way. Oh, don&#8217;t begin to ask questions;
just try to think a little instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I allowed her to have her own way. Indeed, Aline
generally insisted on this, while with many protestations of
gratitude Minnie Fletcher departed the next morning, and
I hoped that the affair was ended. In this I was disappointed,
for, returning with Jasper the next day from an outlying
farm, I found Aline awaiting me in a state of suppressed
excitement. She was paler than usual, and moved
nervously, and the Marlin rifle lay on the table with the
hammer drawn back.</p>
<p>When Jasper volunteered to lead the horses in she
dropped limply into a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spent a terrible afternoon, Ralph. In fact,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
though I feel ashamed of myself, I have not got over it
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>I eased the spring of the rifle and inquired whether
some wandering Blackfoot had frightened her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Aline answered, &#8220;The Indians are in their own
way gentlemen. It was an Englishman. Mr. Thomas
Fletcher called to inquire for his wife, and&mdash;and&mdash;he didn&#8217;t
call sober.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline choked back something between a laugh and a
sob before she continued: &#8220;He came in a wagon with
another little dark man with a cunning face, and walked
into the room before I could stop him. &#8216;I want my runaway
wife, and I mean to find her. Who the deuce are you&mdash;another
of them?&#8217; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found it hard work to keep back the words that
seemed most suitable, and perhaps I was not altogether
successful, while Aline&#8217;s forehead turned crimson and she
clenched her hand viciously as she added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him that I was your sister, and he laughed as he
said&mdash;he didn&#8217;t believe me. Then he swore horribly, and
said&mdash;oh, I can&#8217;t tell you what he said, but he intended to
ruin you, and would either shoot his wife or thrash her to
death, while the man in the wagon sat still, smiling wickedly,
and I grew horribly frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rattle of harness outside increased, and turning I
saw Jasper striding away from the wagon, which stood near
the open doorway, while Aline drew in her breath as she
continued: &#8220;Then Fletcher said he would make me tell
where his wife was, and I determined that he should kill me
first. He came toward me like a wild beast, for there were
little red veins in his eyes, and I moved backward round the
table, feeling perfectly awful, because he reeked of liquor.
Then I saw the rifle and edged away until I could reach it,
and he stopped and said more fearful things, until the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
man jumped out of the wagon and dragged him away. I
think Fletcher was afraid of the other man. So I just sat
down and cried, and wondered whether I should have dared
shoot him, until I found there wasn&#8217;t a cartridge at all in
the rifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this Aline wept copiously again and while, feeling
both savage and helpless, I patted her shoulder, calling her a
brave girl, Jasper looked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t stop and worry Miss Lorimer now,&#8221; he said
shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m borrowing a saddle, and will see you to-morrow.
Good evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kept his promise, for the next morning, when Aline
was herself again, he rode up to the door and came in
chuckling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I have a confession to make,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
help hearing what your sister said, though I kept banging
the harness to let you know I was there, so I figured as to
their probable trail and lit out after them. Came up with
the pair toward nightfall by the big sloo, and invited Mr.
Fletcher to an interview. Fletcher didn&#8217;t seem to see it.
He said he wouldn&#8217;t get down, but mentioned several things&mdash;they&#8217;re
not worth repeating&mdash;about his wife and you,
with a word of your sister that settled me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m a friend of Miss Lorimer&#8217;s. Are you coming
down now,&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m not,&#8217; says Thomas Fletcher; so I just yanked
him right out on to the prairie, and started in with the
new whip to skin him. Asked the other man if he&#8217;d any
objections, but if he had he didn&#8217;t raise them. Then I
hove all that was left of Fletcher right into the sloo, and
rode home feeling considerably better.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed a big hearty laugh, and then started as Aline
came out of an inner room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank you, Mr. Jasper,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
are people with whom one cannot argue, and I think that
thrashing will do him good. I hope that you did it thoroughly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasper swung down his broad hat, fidgeted, and said
awkwardly, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t figure on telling you, but if ever that
man comes round here again, or there&#8217;s any one else scares
you, you won&#8217;t forget to let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline glanced straight into the eyes of the speaker, who
actually blushed with pleasure as she said: &#8220;I will certainly
promise, and I shouldn&#8217;t desire a better champion,
but there is at present no necessity to send you out spreading
devastation upon the prairie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasper looked idiotically pleased at this, and for a time
we heard no more of Thomas Fletcher, who nevertheless
had not forgotten the incident. As the former had anticipated,
the demand for shipping cattle still increased, and
when it was announced that several large steamers were
awaiting the last load before the St. Lawrence was frozen
fast, Jasper rode west to try to pick up a few more head,
and informed me that he would either telegraph or visit
Winnipeg to arrange for the sale before returning. News
travels in its own way on the prairie, and we afterward decided
that Fletcher, who had returned to his deserted home,
must have heard of this. Jasper had been gone several days
when a man in city attire rode up to Fairmead with two
assistants driving a band of stock. He showed me a cattle-salesman&#8217;s
card, and stated that he had agreed with
Jasper to dispose of our beasts on commission, and as the
latter was waiting in Winnipeg, he asked me to ride over
to his homestead to obtain delivery. This I did, and afterward
accompanied him to the railroad, where I saw the
cattle put safely on board a stock train, and early the next
morning I returned, feeling that I had done a good stroke
of business.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>The same afternoon, while Aline prepared a meal, I sat
writing a letter to Harry, telling him with much satisfaction
how well our investment had resulted. Aline listened
with a smile to my running comments, and then remarked
dryly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have forgotten your usual caution for once,
Ralph. You should have gone with them, and seen the
sale. I didn&#8217;t like that man, and once or twice I caught
him looking at you in a way that struck me as suspicious.
I suppose you are sure the firm he represented is good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as good as a bank,&#8221; I answered, and then grew
almost vexed with her, for Aline had an irritating way of
damping one&#8217;s enthusiasm. &#8220;Now try to say something
pleasant, and I&#8217;ll buy you a pair of the best fur mittens in
Winnipeg when we get the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I hope you will get it,&#8221; said Aline, &#8220;for I should
like the gloves. Here is another cattleman going south.&#8221;</p>
<p>She placed more plates on the table, while, throwing down
the pen, I looked out of the window. Here and there the
dry grasses were buried in snow, and a glance at the aneroid
suggested that we might have to accommodate the visitor
all night, for the appearance of the weather was not promising.
He came on at good pace, wrapped in a short fur
coat, and I noticed that he did not ride altogether like the
prairie-born. When he dismounted I led his horse into the
stable before I ushered him into the room. The meal was
almost ready, and we expected him to join us as a matter
of course. He was a shrewd-looking young man with a
pleasant face, and bowed gracefully to Aline as he said in a
straightforward way:</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for your kindness, madam, and must introduce
myself&mdash;James Heysham, of Ross &amp; Grant, high-class
cattle-salesmen. Best market prices, immediate settlements
guaranteed, reasonable commission, and all the rest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
of it. Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Lorimer;
here&#8217;s our card. I rode over from the railroad on the way
to Jasper&#8217;s, to see if I could make a deal with you. Now&#8217;s
the time to realize on your stock, and Ross &amp; Grant the
best firm to entrust them to. Don&#8217;t want to accept your
hospitality under false pretenses, and there are still a few
prejudiced Englishmen who look down on the drummer.
Once waited on a man called Carrington&mdash;and he wasn&#8217;t
even civil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; I said, laughing. &#8220;This is my sister, and
at least we can offer you a meal, but you are too late to
sell our stock. I have just returned from shipping Jasper&#8217;s
as well as my own under charge of a new partner of Gardner&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heysham looked puzzled. &#8220;It&#8217;s a reliable firm&mdash;almost
as good as our own,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You must not smile,
Miss Lorimer; when one earns a living by that talk it&#8217;s
hard to get out of it. But they&#8217;re conservative, and never
send drummers around. Besides, there&#8217;s only Gardner and
his brother&mdash;they haven&#8217;t a partner. Now I wonder
whether&#8221;&mdash;and the last words were unintelligible.</p>
<p>An uneasy feeling commenced to grow on me, and our
guest looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;You suspect something, Mr. Heysham,&#8221; said Aline,
&#8220;and you ought to tell us what it is. I want to know exactly
what you meant when you added &#8216;Confidence men.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I started, and Heysham bowed as he answered:
&#8220;You are evidently new to the wicked ways of this country,
Miss Lorimer. I meant that some unprincipled person has,
I fear, unfortunately taken your brother in. I have suspicions.
Was he a little dark man, or perhaps it was
another, rather stout and red-faced? Still I&#8217;m puzzled as
to how they acquired the local knowledge and learned
enough about your business to fool you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered with a gleam of hope, &#8220;he was
neither;&#8221; but Aline broke in:</p>
<p>&#8220;The man you mention drove here in a wagon some
weeks earlier, and I know how he got the local knowledge&mdash;the
other, with the red face, was Thomas Fletcher. He
lived on the prairie, Mr. Heysham, and there must have
been three in the plot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rose from the table, flinging back my chair, but Heysham
nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly; there are three of them. Your sister has
made it all clear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know the party&mdash;they&#8217;ve
been engineering various shady deals in estate and produce,
and now, when Winnipeg is getting uncomfortably warm,
this is evidently a last coup before they light out across the
boundary. The dark man was a clerk in the stock trade&mdash;turned
out for embezzlement&mdash;once, you see. Still, they
can&#8217;t sell until to-morrow, and we might get the night train.
No chance of trade hereabout, you say; then, for the credit
of our market, if you&#8217;ll lend me a fresh horse, I&#8217;m going
right back to Winnipeg with you. Sit down, and finish
your dinner; you&#8217;ll want it before you&#8217;re through.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at Aline, who was equal to the occasion. &#8220;You
must certainly go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Even if there is a blizzard,
I shall be safe enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>So presently she buttoned the skin coat about me, slipped
a flask of spirits into the pocket; and just before we started
kissed me, saying, &#8220;Take care of yourself, and do your
utmost. There are all poor Jasper&#8217;s cattle besides our own.
Mr. Heysham, I thank you, and whenever you pass this
way remember there&#8217;s a hearty welcome for you at Fairmead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am repaid already, madam,&#8221; said Heysham as we rode
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A RACE WITH TIME</h3>
</div>

<p>A dreary ride lay before us, for already the afternoon
drew toward its close, and the light drifts were eddying
under a bitter wind. The pale sun was still in the
heavens, but a gray dimness crept up from the grass-land&#8217;s
verge toward it, against which the patches of snow gleamed
lividly. However, I thought little about the cold, for with
careless stupidity I had allowed a swindler to rob my partner,
and a succession of blizzards would not have stopped
me then. Heysham, though uninterested, seemed equally
determined, and rode well, so the long miles of grass rolled
behind us. Now a copse of birches flitted past, now a clump
of willows, or the tall reeds of a sloo went down with a
great crackling before us, then there were more swelling
levels, for our course was straight as the crow flies from
horizon to horizon, and we turned aside for no obstacle.</p>
<p>It was dusk when with lowered heads we charged
through the scattered birches of a ravine bluff, and far
down in the hollow beneath I caught the dull gleam of snow-sprinkled
ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mean-looking gully,&#8221; gasped Heysham. &#8220;I guess
that creek&#8217;s not frozen hard, and it&#8217;s pretty deep. Say,
hadn&#8217;t we better lead our horses?&#8221; and I flung an answer
over my shoulder:</p>
<p>&#8220;That will just make the difference between catching
and missing the train. I&#8217;m going down in the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then of course I&#8217;m going too,&#8221; said Heysham breathlessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
&#8220;Your neck is worth as much as mine is anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the next few moments I saw nothing at all but the
shadowy lines of birch stems that went reeling past. A
branch struck Heysham&#8217;s horse, and swerving, it jammed
his leg against a tree; then there was a crash as my own
beast, blundering, charged through a thicket where the brittle
stems snapped like pistol-shots, but the salesman was close
behind me, and with a shout of &#8220;No bridge for miles. I&#8217;ll
show you the way over,&#8221; I drove my horse at the creek.</p>
<p>The quaggy banks were frozen hard now. They were
also rough and ploughed up by the feet of cattle, which had
come there to drink before the frost, and the leap looked
horribly dangerous, for I dare not trust the ice; but the
beast got safely off and came down with a great crackling
amid thinly frozen mud and reeds. There was a splash and
a flounder behind me, and then as we staggered forth Heysham
came up abreast, with the water dripping from his
horse, and I found breath to exclaim:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done! I never should have thought a city man
could bring a horse down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; said Heysham, with more than a suspicion
of dryness. &#8220;In this enlightened country one must earn
one&#8217;s bread as one can, but I wasn&#8217;t brought up to the drummer&#8217;s
calling. Used to ride with&mdash;but that has nothing to
do with you, and I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll strike the railroad on
the shortest possible line. It wouldn&#8217;t be nice to spend
to-night on the prairie.&#8221;</p>
<p>There could be no doubt on this point, for when we
reached the levels darkness had closed down and the air was
thick with uplifted snow which smarted our eyes and made
breathing difficult, while, for the first time, I commenced
to have misgivings. Heysham had understated the case, for
unless we struck the railroad we might very well freeze to
death on the prairie. I explained this to him, and gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
him directions how he could find a farm by following the
creek; but he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an exciting run,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and even life in Winnipeg
grows monotonous. Lead on, I&#8217;m anxious to be in at
the finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The snow came down in earnest before we had made
two more leagues, and, steering partly by the wind and
partly by instinct of direction, I held on half-choked and
blinded, more and more slowly, until, when at last the case
looked hopeless, Heysham shouted, for a telegraph post
loomed up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have reached the railroad, anyway,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The only question is&mdash;how far from the station are we?&#8221;</p>
<p>We drew rein for a few moments beside the graded track,
and shook the snow from our wrappings as we debated the
simple question whose issues were momentous. The horses
were worn out, we were nearly frozen, and the white flakes
whirled more and more thickly about us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can only go and see, and the track at least will
guide us,&#8221; I said at last. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the station can
be many miles away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the journey left but a blurred memory of an
almost sightless struggle through a filmy haze, in which we
occasionally lost each other and touch with the guiding
poles, until at last, caked thick with wind-packed snow, we
caught sight of a pale glimmer, and fell solidly, as it were,
out of the saddle in the shelter of the station. Here, however,
a crushing disappointment awaited us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stopping train passed two hours ago,&#8221; said the station
agent. &#8220;Won&#8217;t be another until the Montreal express
comes through. Heard the stock cars passed Brandon by
daylight&mdash;they&#8217;ll be in Winnipeg now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have one move left,&#8221; said Heysham. &#8220;Hire a
special! Comes high, of course, but it&#8217;s cheaper than losing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
your cattle. They can&#8217;t sell before to-morrow; and you
won&#8217;t be hard on a plundered man, agent? That locomotive
ought to take us through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t cut schedule prices,&#8221; was the answer, after I had
explained. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a single car, but I was saving Number
Forty to haul in wheat, and if she doesn&#8217;t strike a snow-block,
and old Robertson&#8217;s in the humor, she&#8217;ll land you in
Winnipeg before daylight to-morrow. It&#8217;s cutting things
fine, however.&#8221;</p>
<p>We put our horses in the hotel stable, managed as a
special favor to obtain some food in a basket, and then
climbed into the locomotive cab, where the Ontario mechanic
stood rubbing his hands with waste while a grimy
subordinate flung fuel into the roaring furnace.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the best machine for a hard run on this road,&#8221; he
said, as he clutched the lever with professional pride. &#8220;All
you have to do is to sit tight, and I&#8217;ll bring you in on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, panting heavily, Number Forty rolled out from the
station on to the lonely waste, and when, as we jolted over
the switches, the lights died out behind, Robertson became
intent as he shoved the lever home. For a moment the
big drivers whirred on the snow-greased line, then the
wheel-treads bit the metals, and the plates commenced to
tremble beneath our feet. Staring out through a quivering
glass I could see a white haze rising and falling ahead as the
wild gusts came down, driving an icy coldness through the
vibrating cab, while, when these passed, there was only the
glare of the huge head-lamp flickering like a comet down
the straight-ruled track.</p>
<p>Robertson nodded to his fireman, for Heysham had told
him the story, and presently the vibration grew yet sharper.
The gaunt telegraph-posts no longer swept past in endless
files, but reeled toward us under the fan-shaped blaze huddled
all together in a fantastic dance, while willow bluffs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
leaped up out of the whiteness and vanished again as by
magic into the dim prairie. The snow from above had
ceased temporarily. Then a screaming blast struck the
engine, wrapping it about in a dense white cloud that glittered
before the lamp, the glasses rattled, and an impalpable
powder, that seemed to burn the skin, drove in through
every opening. Robertson glanced at his pressure-gauge.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s doing her best,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and she&#8217;ll need to. I
guess we&#8217;ll find drifts in the hollows, and the snow will
come down again presently. It&#8217;s only coming up now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ought to have known better, but, although a British
custom is more honored in the breach than the observance
in Western Canada, I had met men who could pocket their
pride, and, after fumbling in my wallet, I held out a slip of
paper, saying, &#8220;She&#8217;s doing splendidly. I wish you would
buy Mrs. Robertson something with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; was the prompt answer. &#8220;You can keep
your bill. If that fraud gets in ahead of you you&#8217;ll probably
want it. I get good pay, and I earn it, and you&#8217;re not big
enough to give presents to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A new arrival might have been astonished. I only felt
that I had deserved the rebuke, and was thankful that Aline
had slipped the flask and some of Martin Lorimer&#8217;s cigars
into my pocket, while Robertson smiled broadly as in defiance
of his orders he emptied the silver cup. It was a
gift from my cousin Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize. Should have remembered it,&#8221; I said
bluntly.</p>
<p>Then we were racing through stiller air again, with the
driving cloud behind; for each of the curious rushes of
wind that precedes a prairie storm keeps to a definite path
of its own. Several times, with a roar of wheels flung back
to us, we swept through a sleeping town, where thin frame
houses went rocking past until the tall elevators shut them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
in, and again there was only a dim stretch of prairie that
rolled up faster and faster under the front trailing-wheels.</p>
<p>At last, when the lights of Brandon glimmered ahead,
Heysham fell over the fireman as the locomotive jumped to
the checking of the brake, and a colored flicker blinked
beside the track. The glare of another head-lamp beat upon
us as we rolled through the station, while amid the clash of
shocking wheat-cars that swept past I caught the warning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for the snow-block east of Willow Lake!
Freight-train on the single track; wires not working well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll take our chances,&#8221; said Robertson; and
Number Forty panted louder, hurling red sparks aloft as he
rushed her at an up-grade. Still, his brows contracted
when, some time later, he beckoned me, and I saw a wide
lake draw near with silky drifts racing across its black ice.
They also flowed across the track ahead, while beyond it
the loom of what might be a flag station was faintly visible
against a driving bank of cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snow&#8217;s coming off the ice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hold fast! She
may jump a little when I ram her through.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pace grew even faster. We were racing down an
incline, and now, ice, station, and prairie alike were blotted
out by a blinding whiteness; while presently I was flung
backward off my feet, and would have fallen but that I
clutched a guard-rail. The whole cab rattled, the great
locomotive lurched, and a white smother hurtled under the
lamp glare, until once more the motion grew even, and we
could feel the well-braced frame of iron and steel leap
forward beneath us. Engineer Robertson swayed easily to
the oscillation as, with one side of his intent face toward
me, he clutched the throttle lever, until he called hoarsely
as his fingers moved along it. Then, even while the steam
roared in blown-down wreaths from the lifting valve, the
lever was straight at wide-open again, and I caught my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
breath as I made out another yellow halo with something
that moved behind it in the snow ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the freight pulling out of the siding. I can&#8217;t hold
Number Forty up before she&#8217;s over the switches. I guess
we&#8217;ve got to race for it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The fireman did something, and, with a shower of half-burned
cinders from her funnel and a mad blast of the
whistle, Number Forty pounded on. Heysham&#8217;s face was
paler than before, and the disc of yellow radiance grew
nearer and brighter. A faint flash appeared below it, a
deeper whistle reached us brokenly, and I remembered two
hoarse voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re opening the switches! That&#8217;s come on,&#8221; one
of them said. &#8220;Trying to check the freighter! There&#8217;ll
be an almighty smash if they don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other was apparently Heysham&#8217;s: &#8220;And two rascally
confidence men will be skipping for the border with
the proceeds of what should have been Ross &amp; Grant&#8217;s cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said nothing. It did not seem that talking would do
any good, and the engineer might not have welcomed my
advice. The great light was very close. I could see the
cars behind it and hear the grind of brakes, while a man
was bent double over a lever where the blaze of our head-lamp
ran along the ground. The engine rocked beneath
us; there was a heavy lurch as the fore-wheels struck the
points; then Robertson laughed exultantly and wiped his
greasy face. In front lay only the open prairie and flying
snow, while the black shape of the freight-train grew indistinct
behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a pretty close call. Snow blurred the lights, and
I guess the gale has broken a wire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Them
folks never expected us, but they were smart with the
switches. I&#8217;ll say that for them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good man!&#8221; said Heysham. &#8220;She&#8217;s a grand machine.
Next to riding home first in a steeplechase I&#8217;d like to have
the running of a lightning express. Used to do the former
once, but now Fate she says to me, &#8216;You stop right there in
Winnipeg, and sell other men&#8217;s cattle for the best price you
can.&#8217; Lorimer, I think Number Forty has saved that stock
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, shivering as the blasts struck the cab, we
crouched, alternately frozen and roasted, in the most sheltered
corner we could find, while, feeling the pulse of the
great quivering machine with a grimy hand, Robertson
hurled his engine along past Carberry and the slumbering
Portage, until at last, just before the dawn, sheeted white
from head-lamp to tank-rail and dripping below, she came
pounding into Winnipeg.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let that slide. I don&#8217;t like a fuss,&#8221; said Robertson,
when I thanked him. &#8220;Glad to do our best for you,
Forty and me; and I guess the Company haven&#8217;t another
machine short of the inter-ocean racers that would have
brought you in the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then we interviewed the freight-traffic manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;That stock consignment came in hours ago,&#8221; he informed
us. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t unloaded them yet. Anyway,
you&#8217;ll have to hurry and see the police, for we&#8217;re bound to
deliver against shipping bill. Don&#8217;t know how you would
square things after that; and it&#8217;s not my business. Still,
I&#8217;ll have those cars side-tracked where they can&#8217;t be got at
readily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next we sought the police, and, after driving half across
the city, obtained audience with a magistrate, the result
of which was that a detective accompanied us to the station,
and then round the hotels, inquiring for the conspirators
under several different names. None of them, however,
appeared on any hotel register, until we called at a certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
well-known hostelry, where our companion was recognized
by the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess we&#8217;ve got the men you want,&#8221; he said,
with unusual civility for a Western hotel clerk. &#8220;Just
stood some big stock-buyers a high-class breakfast, and
you&#8217;ll find them upstairs. Say, if you want assistance send
right down for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll probably fix them without you,&#8221; was the smiling
answer. &#8220;Only two doors to the place, haven&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ll
leave this man here with you, sending two more to the
other one. Walk straight in, Mr. Lorimer, and see the end
of the play.&#8221;</p>
<p>We entered the bustling coffee-room, where, at the detective&#8217;s
suggestion, I ordered refreshment, and he placed
us at a table behind two pillars. Heysham ate and chatted
in high spirits; but, though hungry enough, I could scarcely
eat at all, and sat still in irresolute impatience for what
seemed an interminable time. I could not get Minnie&#8217;s
worn face out of my memory; and, though her husband&#8217;s
incarceration would probably be a boon to her, I knew she
would not think so. Besides, this deliberate trapping of
a man I had met on terms of friendship, even after what
had happened, was repugnant; and the cattle were safe.
There was, however, nothing to do but wait; for, alert and
watchful, the representative of the law&mdash;who, nevertheless,
made an excellent breakfast&mdash;kept his eyes fixed on the
door, until I would have risen, but that he restrained me,
as, followed by several others, Fletcher and a little dark
man, besides the one who had cajoled the stock from me,
came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stock-buyers!&#8221; whispered the detective, thrusting me
further back. &#8220;Go slow. In the interests of justice, I
want to see just what they&#8217;re going to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newcomers seated themselves not far from the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
side of the pillar, and I waited feverishly, catching snatches
of somewhat vivid general chatter, until one of the party
said more loudly: &#8220;Now let us come down to business.
I&#8217;ve seen the beasts&mdash;had to crawl over the cars to do it&mdash;and
they&#8217;re mostly trash, though there are some that
would suit me, marked hoop L. &amp; J. Say, come down two
dollars a head all around, and I&#8217;ll give you a demand draft
on the bank below for the lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>What followed I did not hear, but by-and-by a voice
broke through the confused murmuring: &#8220;It&#8217;s a deal!&#8221;
An individual scribbling in his pocket-book moved toward
a writing table. Then the detective stepped forward, beckoning
to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to spoil trade, but I&#8217;ve saved your check, gentlemen,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;That stock&#8217;s stolen. Thomas Gorst
and other names, Will Stephens, and Thomas Fletcher,
would you like to glance at this warrant? No! well, it&#8217;s no
use looking ugly, there are men at either door waiting for
you. This is a new trick, Stephens, and you haven&#8217;t played
it neatly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Euchred!&#8221; gasped the little man, while the other
scowled at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confusion to you! In another hour I&#8217;d have been
rustling for the Great Republic. Still, I guess the game&#8217;s
up. Don&#8217;t be a mule, Fletcher; I&#8217;m going quietly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hands with a resigned air, but when,
amid exclamations of wonder, another officer appeared mysteriously
from somewhere to slip on the handcuffs, Fletcher
hurled a decanter into his face and sprang wildly for the
door. He passed within a yard of where I stood. I could
have stopped him readily with an outstretched foot or hand,
but I did neither, and there was an uproar as he plunged
down the stairway with an officer close behind him. The
detective saw his other prisoners handcuffed before he followed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
and though he said nothing he gazed at me reproachfully.
When we stood at the head of the stairs he chuckled
as he pointed below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend hasn&#8217;t got very far,&#8221; he said dryly.</p>
<p>It was true enough, for in the hall a stalwart constable
sat on the chest of a fallen man who apparently strove to
bite him, and I saw that the latter was Thomas Fletcher.
I had clearly been guilty of a dereliction of the honest
citizen&#8217;s duty, but for all that I did not like the manner
in which he said, &#8220;Your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>We returned to the station, and later in the day I entertained
Robertson and Heysham with the best luncheon I
could procure, when for once we drank success to Number
Forty in choice vintages.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t sufficiently thank you, Heysham,&#8221; I said when
we shook hands. &#8220;Now, advise me about those cattle; and
is there anything I can do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enjoyed the fun,&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;and you gave me
a free passage to Winnipeg. I didn&#8217;t do it for that reason,
but if you like to leave the disposal of those beasts to Ross
&amp; Grant, highest-class salesmen, promptest settlements, etc.,
I shall be pleased to trade with you. Sorry to intrude
business, but after all I&#8217;m a drummer, and one must earn
one&#8217;s bread and butter&mdash;see?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had much pleasure in agreeing, and Ross &amp; Grant
sold those beasts to my complete satisfaction and Jasper&#8217;s
as well, while that was but the beginning of a profitable
connection with them, and an acquaintance with Heysham,
who was from the first a friend of Aline&#8217;s and is now sole
partner in the firm. Still, though I returned to Fairmead
with the proceeds, satisfied, it transpired that Thomas
Fletcher was not yet past doing me a further injury.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>ON THE GOLD TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Nothing further of moment happened for a time.
Fletcher, protesting his innocence, lay awaiting trial
with his accomplices, and I had been warned that I should
be called on to give evidence, which I was unwilling to
do; and, after consulting a solicitor, I endeavored in the
meantime to forget the disagreeable affair. Then one
morning, when the snow lay thick on the shingles, and the
creek in the ravine was frozen almost to the bottom, the
fur-wrapped postman brought me a letter from Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have only good news,&#8221; it ran. &#8220;We have piled up
beams and stringers ahead of contract, and sold a number of
logs a snow-slide brought us at a good profit, ready for
floating down to a new sawmill in the valley. That, however,
is by the way. As you know, Johnston has quartz
reefs on the brain, and now fancies he is really on the track
of one. There have been rumors of rich gold west of the
Fraser, and one of our prospecting friends came in almost
snow-blind with promising specimens. Nothing will stop
Johnston, and I&#8217;m bitten myself, so the fact is we&#8217;re going
up to find that gold. Of course, it&#8217;s the wrong time; but
there&#8217;ll be a rush in spite of that. In short, we want you,
and I managed to secure this railroad pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>I showed Aline the letter, and she said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
go? I can stay with the Kenyons; they have often asked
me. It would be splendid, wouldn&#8217;t it, if you were to find
a gold mine?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>I nodded rather gravely. Gold mines worth developing
are singularly hard to find, and when found generally need
a large capital to work them, while the company financier
gets the pickings. The steady following up of one consistent
plan more commended itself to me, and prospecting
in mid-winter would try the strength of a giant. Still, if
my partners were bent on it they would naturally expect
me to humor them in the matter, and there was a hope of
seeing Grace, so I answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish they had never heard of it; but, if Mrs. Kenyon
will take care of you for a few weeks, I must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline was evidently prepared to bear my absence philosophically,
and, perhaps because one of Mrs. Kenyon&#8217;s sons
was a handsome stripling, she spent all day sewing, while I
gathered up my belongings and rode over to interview that
lady, who had lately come out from Ontario, and professed
herself delighted to receive my sister. Thus it happened
that one morning before daybreak I stood beside a burdened
pack-horse with a load of forty pounds strapped about my
shoulders, outside a log shanty, ready to strike out into the
snow-bound northern wilderness. Johnston, who was in
high spirits, held the bridle of another horse, and Harry
whistled gaily as with the assistance of a prospector he
strapped a heavy collection of sundries upon its back, while
the owner of the shanty watched us with a fine assumption
of pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of gold up yonder! Well, I guess there is,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But maybe you&#8217;ll get mighty tired before you find
it, and this isn&#8217;t quite the season to go sloshing round
glaciers and snow-fields. Don&#8217;t I wish I was coming?
Can&#8217;t say I do. Go slow and steady is my motto, and you&#8217;ll
turn more gold out of the earth with the plough than you
ever will with the drill, and considerably easier, too.
There&#8217;s another outfit yonder ahead of you, and a third one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
coming along. Look in this way if you come back hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnston smote the pack-horse, and there was a clash of
rifles, axes, tin pans and kettles as we moved off into the
forest, which was free of undergrowth here.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a sensible man,&#8221; I observed. &#8220;Harry, I
can&#8217;t help feeling that this gold hunting is not our business,
and no good will come of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you needn&#8217;t say so,&#8221; Harry answered shortly.
&#8220;If I were troubled with old women&#8217;s presentiments I
should keep them to myself. The man we have with us
knows the country well, and from what the other half
revealed we ought to find something. I&#8217;m wondering who
got up the other expedition, unless it&#8217;s Ormond. The Day
Spring is doing even worse lately, and the Colonel has
gone down to Vancouver to raise fresh funds or sell it to
a company, which would be rough on the company. Your
uncle and your cousin are wintering there.&#8221;</p>
<p>This gave me food for thought, and I trudged on,
dreamily noticing how the tramp of feet and the clatter of
metal broke through the ghostly silence, while half-seen
figures of man and beast appeared and vanished among the
trunks, and the still woods seemed listening to our march.
I knew that in the old days the feet of a multitude had
worn trails through these ranges as they pressed on toward
the treasure of Cassiar and Caribou, and that the bones of
many were strewn broadcast across the region into which
we were venturing. Perhaps it was because of the old
Lancashire folk-lore I once had greedily listened to, but
I could not altogether disbelieve in presentiments, and my
dislike to the journey deepened until Johnston&#8217;s voice rose
clearly through the frosty air: &#8220;There&#8217;s shining gold in
heaps, I&#8217;m told, by the banks of Sacramento.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest was the usual forecastle gibberish, but, and it
may have been that our partner being born with the wanderer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
spirits could give meaning to the immemorial calling
that speaks to the hearts of the English through the rude
chanteys of the sea, something stirred me when the refrain
rose up exultantly, &#8220;Blow, boys, blow, for Californio, for
there&#8217;s shining gold and wealth untold on the sunny Sacramento.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he learn the trick of it?&#8221; said Harry.
&#8220;There&#8217;s certainly nothing in the words, and yet that song
takes hold. I dare say many a poor deserter devil has
marched to his death to it. The seamen came up with the
vanguard when they found gold in Caribou. Wake up, and
ring it out, Ralph. A tribute to the fallen. &#8216;Hey ho,
Sacramento!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>I have heard that chantey since. On certain occasions
Harry brings out its final chords on the Fairmead piano
with a triumphant crash that has yet a tremble in it, and
each time it conjures up a vision of spectral pines towering
through the shadow that veils the earth below, while above
the mists the snow lies draped in stainless purity waiting
for the dawn. Then I know that Harry, who is only a
tiller of the soil, had learned in the book of nature to grasp
the message of that scene, and interpret it through the close
of a seaman&#8217;s ballad.</p>
<p>The full story of our journey would take long to tell,
and a recital of how we struggled through choked forests,
floundered amid the drifts in the passes, or crawled along
the icy rock-slope&#8217;s side, might prove monotonous. We
left the ashes of our camp-fires in many a burnt brul√©e and
among the boulders of lonely lakes, but though, after one
pack-horse fell over a precipice, provisions ran out rapidly,
we failed to find the gorge the prospector talked about; or
rather, because the whole land was fissured by them, we
found many gorges, but each in succession proved to be
the wrong one. Then we held consultations, and the prospector
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
suggested that we should return and try again in the
spring, to which Harry agreed. Johnston, however, would
not hear of this, and said with a strange assurance:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s the gambler&#8217;s spirit, but I&#8217;ve gone prospecting
somewhat too often before, and if one only keeps
on long enough the luck is bound to turn. This time I
seem to know it&#8217;s going to. Still, I&#8217;ll fall in with the
majority. Ralph, as head of the firm you have the casting
vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, and I always regretted it, I said: &#8220;We should
never have come at all. No sensible person goes prospecting
in mid-winter; but, being here, we had better spend
three days more. That means further reduced rations, but
if we find nothing by the third noon we&#8217;ll turn back forthwith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others agreed, and on the second night we lay in
camp in a burnt forest. We were all tired and hungry,
and&mdash;for Johnston was silent&mdash;a melancholy settled down
upon the camp, while I lay nearly frozen under two blankets,
watching a half-moon sail slowly above the fretted
ridge of firs. At last Johnston spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow is the fatal day. Ralph has the look of
an unsatisfied wolf; you are hungry, Harry; we are all
hungry, and such is mortal man that at this moment my
soul longs more than all things for even the most cindery
flapjack that ever came out of a camp cook&#8217;s frying-pan.
Still, I&#8217;m not going home &#8217;returned empty&#8217; this time, and
fragments of a forgotten verse keep jingling through my
head. It&#8217;s an encouraging stanza, to the effect that, though
often one gets weary, the long, long road has a turning, and
there&#8217;s an end at last. It would be particularly nice if it
ended up in a quartz reef that paid for the stamping,
especially when one might square up some of one&#8217;s youthful
misdeeds with the proceeds. Ever heard me moralizing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
Ralph? The question is whether one can ever square the
reckoning of such foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought about it,&#8221; I answered, remembering
how when Johnston harangued the railroaders&#8217; camp, banjo
in hand, he would mix up the wildest nonsense with sentiment.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s an axiom, isn&#8217;t it, that a man must pay for
his fun, and if you will go looking for gold mines in winter
you can&#8217;t expect to be comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t thought about it,&#8221; said Johnston. &#8220;Ralph,
all things considered, you are a lucky individual. What can
man want better than to win his way to fortune, and the
love of a virtuous maid, tramping behind his oxen under
clear sunshine down the half-mile furrow, looking only for
the harvest, and sowing hope with the grain. There&#8217;s a
restfulness about it that appeals to me. Some men are born
with a chronic desire for rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you were among them,&#8221; I answered
irritably; &#8220;and there&#8217;s precious little rest in summer on
the prairie;&#8221; but Johnston continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I too loved a virtuous maiden, and, stranger still, I
fancy she loved me, but unfortunately there was one of the
other kind too, and the result thereof was as usual&mdash;disaster.
I&#8217;ve been trying to remedy that disaster&mdash;did you
ever wonder where my dividends went to? Well, there
is a reason why I&#8217;m anxious to find a mine. If we do, I&#8217;ll
tell you the sequel. Otherwise&mdash;and things do happen
unexpectedly&mdash;there&#8217;s a leather case in my pocket, and in
case of accident I hope my partners will act on what they
find in it. Perhaps some one in England would bless them
if they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ceased, and some time later a vibratory monotone
commenced far up under the stars, gathering strength and
volume until it rolled in long pulsations down the steep
ranges&#8217; side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more common in spring,&#8221; remarked the prospector,
&#8220;but some ice bridge has busted under pressure, and the
snow is coming down. There&#8217;ll be most astonishing chaos
in the next valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>I cannot say how long the great harmony lasted, for we
listened spellbound, unheeding the passage of time, while the
cedars trembled about us as the tremendous diapason leaped
from peak to peak and the valleys flung back the echoes in
majestic antiphones. There was the roar of sliding gravel,
the crash of rent-down forest, and the rumble of ice and
snow, each mingling its own note, softened by distance, in
the supernatural orchestra, until the last echoes died away
and there was a breathless hush.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have heard great things,&#8221; said Johnston; &#8220;what did
the surveyor say? Not an ounce of the ruin is wasted;
the lower Fraser wheat-lands are built that way. There&#8217;s
a theme for a master to write a Benedicite. Grinding ice
chanting to the thunders of the snow, and the very cedars
listening in the valleys. Well, I&#8217;ll make him a free present
of the fancy; we&#8217;re merely gold miners, or we hope to be.
Good-night, and remember the early start to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was up long before the late dawn, and it was still
early when we waded scarcely knee-deep among the boulders
of a curiously shrunken stream. Smooth-ground rocks
cumbered its bed, and the muddy water that gurgled among
them was stained red instead of the usual glacial green,
while, as I wondered where the rest had gone, the prospector
remarked, &#8220;These blamed rivers are low in winter, but
I never saw one quite so ashamed of itself as this. It&#8217;s the
snow-slide we heard last night damming the valley, and
there&#8217;ll be a rush worth seeing when it does break through.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had occasion afterward to learn that he was right, but
meanwhile we followed the banks of the river up-stream,
still looking for the gorge. Several times the prospector
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
fancied that he identified a transverse opening, and then
confessed that he was not even sure of the river, because,
as he said, there were so everlasting many of them. Johnston
grew more and more uneasy, until, when I called a
halt as the sun bore south, he looked at me appealingly,
and I agreed to continue until there was just time enough
left to reach our previous camp by nightfall. So we held
on, and finally he turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve played the last game and lost it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well,
you kept your part of the bargain; I&#8217;ll keep mine. It&#8217;s take
up the home-trail, boys, we&#8217;re going back to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it lightly, but I could tell that he felt the disappointment
bitterly, while even I, who had expected nothing,
wheeled the pack-horse around with an angry growl.
It was toward dusk when we neared the creek we had
crossed in the morning, but it was no longer shrunken.
Evidently the dam of d√©bris had given way, for it roared
in full flood now, and it was with anxiety that we quickened
our pace. The hillsides loomed black out of chilly mist that
wrapped the serried ranks of climbing pines in their smoky
folds. It was not yet dark in the valley, but the light was
dying fast, and a bitter breeze swept down a darkening
gorge, bringing with it the moan of an unseen forest until
presently this was lost in the voice of the frothing torrent
before us. There was neither fuel nor shelter on that side,
and we determined to attempt the crossing, for, as Harry
said, &#8220;Hunger alone is bad, but hunger and cold together
are worth an effort to avoid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prospector waded in foremost, sounding with a long
fir pole. The stream swirled in white wreaths about his
waist, and Johnston turned to speak to me, standing a few
yards nearer with the ripples at his knee; then I grasped
the pack-horse&#8217;s bridle and forced it into the water. The
beast carried a heavy load, including most of our blankets,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
and almost the entire balance of our provisions. A rusty
rifle was slung behind my shoulders, besides tools and
utensils, and Johnston was similarly caparisoned, so I felt
my way cautiously as the ice-cold waters frothed higher
about me. Near by, the creek poured into the main river,
which swept with a great black swirling into the gloom of
the forest.</p>
<p>All went well until we gained the center of the stream,
and then a loose stone turned under the horse&#8217;s hoof, or it
sank into a deeper hollow, for there was a plunge and a
flounder, and, jerked sideways by the bridle, I went down
headforemost into the stream. This was a common enough
accident, but the bridle slipped from my fingers, and when
some seconds later I stood erect, gasping, with the torrent
racing past me, the horse was swimming down-stream a
dozen yards away, while Johnston struggled in that direction
to intercept it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it go!&#8221; I roared. &#8220;Water&#8217;s deepening; you&#8217;ll be
sucked out into the main river,&#8221; and caught the answer,
&#8220;All our provisions there!&#8221; after which there was a confused
shouting, which ended in the warning, &#8220;For the Lord&#8217;s
sake, Johnston, look out for yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could see that our best chance of rendering assistance
would be to cross and try to overtake them from the further
bank, and a few seconds later I was clattering over the
shingle with the prospector close behind me. But we were
already too late. When, waist-deep, I floundered down a
shingle spit, the half-submerged beast, handicapped by its
burden, swept past out of reach, and I caught a momentary
glimpse of a wet white face and a man&#8217;s uplifted arm before
a tumbling ridge splashed up and hid them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t never overtake them, but it&#8217;s running slacker
in the river,&#8221; the prospector said.</p>
<p>We smashed through a willow thicket which covered a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
little promontory, and then, staring wide-eyed under the
branches, I saw an indistinct object lurch unevenly into the
froth of a rapid, and so pass the next instant out of sight.
Whether it was man or horse no one could say.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said the grizzled prospector. &#8220;Many another
has gone the same way. Find them! Of course,
we&#8217;ll search, but I guess it&#8217;s hopeless. Don&#8217;t think your
partner was great on swimming, and he was loaded heavy.
Come on, daylight&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment I felt limp and abject, then in savage
fury I broke through barberry branches and thorny brakes,
fell into the river, and blundered down a shoaler portion of
its channel, until I brought up breathless on the verge of a
deep boiling pool, while even as I stared across it the last
of the day went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds hard,&#8221; said the prospector, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t do
nothin&#8217;. No man could make his way through this bush
in the dark, and it wouldn&#8217;t be any good. Your partner
never got so far. We can only say we&#8217;re sorry, and strike
back for camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right, though I think I cursed him for cowardice
then. We struggled on through a horrible chaos of tangled
forest, but each time when, peering out between the dark
fir branches, I cried aloud, the blackness returned no answer
save the boom of angry water. So, bruised, wet, and
bleeding, I struggled back toward the fatal creek, and found
that my lips would not frame words to answer when Harry
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was horrible, Ralph. I&#8217;d give all our hopes and prospects
to have the poor fellow safe again. But there&#8217;s no
help for it, and somehow I fancy it was a release. You
remember how he looked when he said that this was his last
march?&#8221;</p>
<p>We lighted a fire, dried our garments and the blankets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
that were left us, then Harry flung aside the battered camp
spider, and drew out a flask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten pounds of flour, five of reistit pork&mdash;and that&#8217;s
what he gave his life for. No, I don&#8217;t think I could eat
anything to-night. Here, empty half of this, Ralph, you&#8217;re
shaking all over,&#8221; and Harry lifted his hat as he touched
the metal cup with his lips: &#8220;Good rest to you, comrade,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>I choked over the mouthful of spirits, which I needed
badly enough, and then sat shivering wide awake beside the
fire through the long bitter night, while when at daybreak
I called the others, they both rose with a suspicious readiness.
For hours we wandered along the river bank, but
found nothing whatever beyond conclusive evidence that
even the best swimmer could hardly have come out of that
icy flood alive. Then dejectedly we strapped up our traps,
and turned our backs on the dismal camp. We halted and
looked back a moment on the crest of the divide.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beast was badly played out,&#8221; the guide said, &#8220;the
man was loaded. Thirty pounds and a rifle&mdash;and he
couldn&#8217;t hardly swim. He&#8217;s gone out on the lonely trail,
but whether there&#8217;s gold at the end of it no living man can
say. Maybe you&#8217;ll find out some day when you follow
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then in mournful silence we turned away, and that
night we ate our last mouthful in another valley, and forgot
the gnawing hunger in broken sleep, through which a
wet face persistently haunted me. When we arose there
was not even a handful of caked flour in the damp bag, and
during a discussion the miner, in reply to Harry&#8217;s statement,
said it did not follow that there were no deer or bear
in the country because we had not seen them. Men tramping
noisily behind shod horses do not generally chance upon
the shy deer, he pointed out; while if two previous hunts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
had proved unsuccessful, we might do better on the third.
It was at least four days&#8217; march to the nearest dwelling, and
I agreed with his observation that no starving men could
march for four days through such a country. So, to enhance
our chances, the company divided, agreeing to meet
again, if they killed nothing, at the same spot by sunset.</p>
<p>It was with a heavy heart and my belt drawn tighter
that I left the others, carrying a loaded rifle, which seemed
to increase considerably in weight. Now, even well north
in British Columbia, especially if near the Pacific, there are
favored valleys sunk deep among the ranges and open to
the west which escape the harder frost, and as this was one
of them I determined to search the half-frozen muskegs for
bear. The savage grizzly lives high under the ragged
peaks, the even fiercer cinnamon haunts the thinly-covered
slopes below, but I had no desire to encounter either of
them, for the flesh of the little vegetable-feeding black bear
is by no means unpalatable, especially to starving men.</p>
<p>So I prowled from swamp to swamp, seeing nothing but
the sickly trunks which grew up out of thinly frozen slime,
while no sound made by either bird or beast broke the impressive
silence of the primeval solitude. At last, when
the day was nearly spent, I crawled toward a larger muskeg,
which spread out from a running creek, and knelt in
congealed mire behind a blighted spruce, listening intently,
for a sound I recognized set my heart beating. All around,
dwindling in gradations as the soil grew wetter, the firs
gave place to willows, and there was mud and ice cake
under them. Peering hard into the deepening shadows, I
saw what I had expected&mdash;a patch of shaggy fur. This
was one of the small black bears, and the creature was
grubbing like a hog among the decaying weed for the roots
of the wild cabbage, which flourishes in such places. Some
of these bears hibernate in winter, I believe, but by no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
means all, for the bush settlers usually hunt them then for
their fur. No summer peltry is worth much.</p>
<p>I was only a fair shot with the rifle, and the strip of
black, half seen between the branches, would prove a difficult
mark in an uncertain light, while it was probable that
three lives might answer for the bear&#8217;s escape. So I waited,
aching in every joint, while my hands grew stiffer on the
rifle stock, but still the beast refrained from making a
target of itself, until, knowing that it would soon be too
dark to shoot, I had to force the crisis. A strange sound
might lead the quarry to show himself an instant before
taking flight, and so I moistened my blue lips and whistled
shrilly. A plump rotund body rose from the weeds, sixty
yards away, I guessed, and I pitched up the rifle, dropping
my left elbow well over my knee and steadying the cold
barrel against the tree.</p>
<p>Sixty yards and a two-foot target, what need for such
precautions? one hears the marksmen say, and when stalking
sand-hill cranes in warm sunlight now I can agree with
them. But I was nearly famished, stiff with cramp and
cold, and shooting then for bare existence. With a half-articulate
prayer I increased the pressure on the trigger as
the fore-bead trembled&mdash;it would tremble&mdash;across the fur.
The bear was clearly suspicious. He would be off the
next moment, the trigger was yielding, and with a sudden
stiffening of every muscle I added the final pressure as the
notch in the rear-sight and the center of the body came
for a moment in line. I heard no explosion&mdash;one rarely
does when watching the result intently&mdash;but there was a
red flash from the tilting muzzle, and the heel-plate jarred
my shoulder. Then I growled with satisfaction as almost
simultaneously I heard a sound there was no mistaking, the
crunch of a forty-four bullet smashing through flesh and
bone. The bear was down, straggling among the weed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
and plunging straight through the muskeg I fell upon it,
and, after burning another cartridge with the muzzle against
the flesh, I drove the long knife in to the hilt.</p>
<p>Next I rose stiffly upright, ensanguined, with wild gasps
of thankfulness, and sent a hoarse cry ringing across the
woods, after which I sat down on the fur and stabbed the
lifeless brute twice again, for I was filled with a childish fear
that even now it might escape me. This was needless, and
even barbarous, but to one in my position it was natural.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE BRINK OF ETERNITY</h3>
</div>

<p>A shout came down from the range side, and when
the others joined me even Harry surveyed the bear with
wolfish eyes, while it did not take long to perform what the
French-Canadians call the <i>√©ventrer</i>, and, smeared red all
over, we bore the dismembered carcass into camp. We
feasted like wild beasts&mdash;we were frankly animal then&mdash;and
it was not until hunger was satisfied that we remembered
the empty place. Then we drew closer together, and, though
it was mere fancy, the gloom of the forest seemed to thicken
round the circle of fading firelight, as Harry said:</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the life of the party at either work or feast.
Ralph, we shall miss him sorely; a sound sleep to him!&#8221;</p>
<p>No one spoke again, and, drawing the two remaining
blankets across the three, we sank into our couches of
spruce twigs and slept soundly. It was after midnight, by
the altitude of the moon, when the prospector roused me,
and I sat up with chattering teeth, for there was a bitter
wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear it?&mdash;there&mdash;again!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I was not quite awake, and, when a tramp of footsteps
came faintly out of the obscurity, at first I felt only elation.
Johnston had escaped and followed our trail, I thought.
This was short-lived, and was replaced by superstitious
dread, for there could be no human being within leagues of
us, and yet the ghostly footsteps drew steadily nearer and
nearer. Even the miner, who had spent half his life in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
ranges seemed uneasy, for he stretched out his hand for the
rifle, and Harry started upright as a challenge rang through
the stillness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop there, and call out what you want, whoever you
are!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer from the silence, only the footsteps
still approaching, and Harry looked at me curiously
when the miner called again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep back&mdash;tell us who you are before we fire on
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a hoarse voice reached us: &#8220;If you have nothing
to eat it won&#8217;t matter much if you do. We are three
starving men, and past doing anybody an injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come forward,&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;We have food here,&#8221; and
three figures staggered into the glow of the fire. The
foremost seemed familiar, and I could not repress a start
when the red blaze leaped up, for Geoffrey Ormond stood
before us leaning heavily on a rifle. His face was thin and
furrowed, his coat badly rent, and his very attitude spoke
of utter weariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lorimer, by all that&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;You were not exactly friendly the last time we met. In
fact, I almost fancied you wished to ride over me. I hope
we&#8217;re not intruding, but we&#8217;re most confoundedly hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last words were unnecessary, for the way the men
behind him glanced at the meat showed it plainly enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must apologize for a fit of temper,&#8221; I said, holding
out my hand, &#8220;but it happened near the settlements, and old
quarrels don&#8217;t hold up here. We have food to give you,
and we hope that you will consider yourselves welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>They certainly did so, for more bear steaks were laid
on the embers, and while one of the newcomers, stripping a
cartridge, rubbed powder grains into the flesh another produced
a few of the fern roots which in times of scarcity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
the Siwash Indians eat. When at last they had finished,
one of the party, pushing back his fur cap, turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to remember me, Lorimer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do, Calvert. Didn&#8217;t you hire my horses,
once?&#8221; I replied. &#8220;You must take my meaning the right
way when I say that I&#8217;m pleased to see you here. But
what brought you and the others into this desolation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Calvert&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;The same thing that brought
you&mdash;stories of unlimited treasure. When I heard them I
left my few machines&mdash;they were not working well, and
humbly craved the autocratic president of the Day Spring
mine&#8217;s permission to join this expedition. The Day Spring
was not prospering in such a degree that we could afford
to ignore the rumors&mdash;eh, Geoffrey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may put it so,&#8221; said Ormond quietly. &#8220;But
Colonel Carrington is your acknowledged chief, and you
owe him due respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the narrator continued, &#8220;we came up, six sanguine
men and one despondent mule, which showed its wisdom
by breaking its tether and deserting. I gather that these
expeditions are generally rough on cattle. Then we lost our
way, and, provisions growing scanty, divided the party, three
returning and three holding on, Geoffrey and I, unfortunately,
among the latter. We got lost worse than ever on the
return journey, and were steering south, we hoped, at the
last gasp, so to speak, when we found you. That&#8217;s about all,
but, if it&#8217;s a fair question, did you find any sign of gold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a sign,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours was a triple combination,&#8221; Ormond said.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s your cheerful partner; I liked him. Ah, excuse
an unfortunate question&mdash;a difference of opinion most
probably?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;We never had a difference of
opinion since poor Johnston joined us. He lies somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
in a nameless river&mdash;we lost him crossing a treacherous
ford two days ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ormond looked startled for a moment, then he bent his
head and answered with a kindly glance toward me: &#8220;He
was a good comrade, and you have my deep sympathy. May
I say that sometimes I fancied your friend could tell a painful
story, and in endeavoring to forget it made the most of
the present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are probably right,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;He hinted as
much, but no one will learn that story now. He took his
secret with him, and the river guards it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an old tale,&#8221; said Ormond gravely. &#8220;The way
into this country was opened by the nameless unfortunate.
After all, where could a man rest better than among the
ranges through which he had found a pathway. Are not
these dark pines grander than any monument? Poor Johnston!
Lorimer, I wonder, if we knew all, whether we
should pity him?&#8221;</p>
<p>His face grew somber as he spoke, but it was Ormond
who presently dissipated the gloom by a humorous narrative
of the doings of the vanished mule, after which we went to
sleep again. A pale blink of sunshine shone down when
we started south the next day, for we had agreed to march
in company, but the weary leagues lengthened indefinitely,
and there was still no sign of the eagerly expected trail
leading to Macdonald&#8217;s Crossing, until, when we almost despaired
of finding it, one of the party assured us that we
should reach it before the second nightfall. During the morning
Ormond and I lagged behind the others as we wound
with much precaution along the sides of an almost precipitous
descent. He limped from some small injury to his foot,
made worse by exposure, and as it happened a passing
mention of Colonel Carrington stirred up the old bitterness.</p>
<p>Why should this man enjoy so much while I had so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
little, I thought. I was handicapped by poverty, and his
wealth lay like an impassable barrier between Grace and
myself. Then, though I tried hard, I could not drive out
the reflection that all would have been different if he had not
found our camp. Our partner had gone down in the black
pool; we could not save him, but chance had made it easy
to succor the one man who could bring me sorrow in his
necessity. Then, as I struggled to shake off the feeling of
sullen resentment, Ormond perhaps noticed my preoccupation,
for he remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;In other circumstances how we should enjoy this
prospect, Lorimer!&#8221;</p>
<p>We halted a few minutes, and I agreed with him as I
glanced about me. A great slope of snow ran upward
above us, and as far as eye could see there was a white
confusion of glittering ranges. The footprints of our
comrades wound in zig-zags among deep drifts and outcrops
of ice-touched rock across the foreground, and perhaps
twenty feet below the ledge on which we stood a smooth
slide of frozen snow dropped steeply toward the edge of a
precipice, through a gully in which we could see the tops
of the climbing pines far beneath. A few small clumps of
bushes and spruce rose out of this snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awkward place for a lame man, but if we wait
much longer we will lose the others,&#8221; said Ormond, pointing
to the distant figures struggling across the dazzling
incline.</p>
<p>He moved a few steps, then there was a stumble and a
sudden cry. I saw him for a moment slipping down the
slanted surface of the rock, and when I reached the edge
he hung apparently with one foot on a slippery stone, and
his left hand clawing wildly at the snow, which yielded under
it. I think his other fingers were in a crevice. The fall
might not be dangerous in itself, but it seemed impossible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
that anybody launched upon that declivity could escape a
glissade over the precipice. This struck me in an instant
and, grasping a shrub which grew in a crevice, I held out
my right hand toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get hold, lift yourself with your foot, and I&#8217;ll drag you
up!&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He made a desperate effort, for I could see the veins
swell on his forehead, but it was the injured foot which
had found hold, and when his chest was level with the edge,
still clawing at the treacherous covering, he commenced to
slip back again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do it. Let go, before I pull you over too!&#8221; he
gasped.</p>
<p>One reads that in cases of imminent peril men&#8217;s
memories have been quickened and past events rise up
before them, but nothing of this kind happened to me, for
as far as recollection serves I was conscious only that I could
not recover my own balance now, and that there were great
beads of sweat on the forehead of the man struggling for
his life below who stared up with starting eyes, while my
right arm seemed slowly being drawn out of its socket. So
I fought for breath, and held on, while I fancy Ormond
choked out again: &#8220;You fool, let go!&#8221; and then, with slow
rending, the roots of the shrub gave way, and we plunged
downward together.</p>
<p>Ormond was undermost, and he must have struck an
uncovered rock heavily, for I heard a thudding shock, and
the next moment, driving my heels into the snow, I swept
down the incline at a speed which threatened to drive the
little sense left in me completely away. Nevertheless, I
noticed that Ormond rushed downward head foremost
several yards away, and there was a loud crash when he
charged through a juniper thicket, and then struck violently
against a spruce, which brought him up almost on the verge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
of the gully. By good luck I slid into a clump of stout
saplings, and presently rose to my knees, blinking about me
in a dazed fashion. One thing, however, was evident&mdash;any
rash move would launch me over the sheer fall.
Ormond lay still against the slender trunk, and several minutes
passed before he raised his head. There was a red stain
on the snow beside him, and his voice was uneven.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not a judicious man, Lorimer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
infinitely obliged to you, but no one would have blamed
you for letting go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let that pass,&#8221; I answered shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I
did not. We are in an awkward place, and the first thing is
to decide how to get out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a wry smile on Ormond&#8217;s face when he
spoke again: &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a perilous position, and a somewhat
unusual one. You and I&mdash;of all men&mdash;to be hung
up here together on the brink of eternity. Still I, at least,
am doubtful whether I&#8217;ll ever get out again; there&#8217;s something
badly broken inside of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hot blood surged to my forehead, for I understood
what he meant, but that was a side issue, and, answering
nothing, I scanned the slope for some way of ascent. There
was none, and nothing without wings could have gained the
valley. Ormond, too, realized this.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we can do, Lorimer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is to wait until our
friends assist us. In the meantime you might fire your rifle
to suggest that they hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke very thickly. I scraped the snow from the
slung weapon&#8217;s muzzle, for this will sometimes burst a gun,
and then a red flash answered the ringing report from the
opposite slope, and presently a cry reached us from the foremost
of the clambering figures. &#8220;Hold on! We&#8217;re coming
to get you out!&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Now most luckily we had brought several stout hide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
ropes with us, which was a rather unusual procedure.
The British Columbian mountaineer will carry a flour bag
over moraine and glacier trusting only to the creeper spikes
on his heels, and in objecting to the extra weight our guide
said derisively: &#8220;We&#8217;ve quite enough to pack already, and
I guess you don&#8217;t want to dress us up with a green veil, a
crooked club with a spike in the end of it, and fathoms of
spun hemp, like them tourist fellows bring out to sit in the
woods with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I insisted, and now we were thankful for
the coupled lariats. They could not lower them directly
toward me because of a tree, and when the end lay resting
on the snow several yards away I braced myself to attempt
the risky traverse. The slope was pitched as steeply as the
average roof, and there was ice beneath the frost-dried
powder that slid along it. Leaving the rifle behind, I drove
the long blade of my knife deep down for a hand-hold before
the first move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie flat and wriggle!&#8221; called a man above. &#8220;Jam the
steel into the hard cake beneath!&#8221; and with the cold sweat
oozing from my hair I proceeded to obey him. How long
I took to cover the distance we could not afterward agree,
but once I lay prone for minutes together, with both arms
buried in the treacherous snow, which was slipping under
me, and the end of the lariat a foot or two away. Then
with a snake-like wriggle I grasped it, and there was a cry
of relief from the watchers. I got a bight around Ormond&#8217;s
shoulders, and after some difficulty fastened it. One cannot
use ordinary knots on hide. Ready hands gathered in
the slack, and my rival was drawn up swiftly, while they
guided him diagonally around instead of under the jutting
shelf from which we had fallen.</p>
<p>Then the end came down again, and with it fast about
my shoulders I went back for the rifle, after which they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
hauled me up, filling my neck and both sleeves with snow
in the process. Though Harry laughed, his voice trembled
when, as I gained the platform, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done, partner! You fought gamely, and if
you had eaten another bear we should never have landed
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry, I think, had been at one time a trout fisher.
Ormond, however, after making an effort to rise, lay limply
in the snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry to trouble you, but I can&#8217;t get up,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Something gone wrong internally and my leg&#8217;s
broken. I&#8217;m much afraid you will have to carry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an arduous undertaking, and even before starting
it was necessary to lash his limbs together with a rifle
between them by way of splint. After this we spent two
hours traversing the next mile or so, and my shoulders
ached when with intense satisfaction we found firm earth
beneath our feet once more. Ormond was distinctly
heavy, and that region is sufficiently difficult to traverse
even by a wholly unburdened man, while, hampered by his
weight, the two days&#8217; march to the crossing might be
lengthened indefinitely. Still, we could not leave him
there, and, framing two spruce poles with branches between
them into a litter, we struggled forward under our burden.
We were five partly fed and worn-out men in all, and we
carried the litter alternately by twos and fours, finding the
task a trying one either way. Probably we could never
have accomplished it except under pressure of necessity.</p>
<p>The bronze already had faded in the sufferer&#8217;s face, his
cheeks had fallen in, but though the jolting must have
caused him severe pain at times he rarely complained.
Instead, he would smile at us encouragingly, or make some
pitiful attempt at a jest, and I think it was chiefly to please
us that he choked down a few spoonfuls of the very untempting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
stew we forced on him. Once, too, when I tried to
feed him his eyes twinkled, though his lips were blanched, as
he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are playing out our parts in a most unconventional
fashion. Ralph Lorimer, are you sure that it is not poison
you are giving me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps he would have said more if I had followed his
lead, but I did not do so, and these two veiled references
were all that passed between us on the subject that most
concerned us until almost the end. It was late one night,
but there was a beaten trail beneath us and we knew we
were running a race for Ormond&#8217;s life, when at last a
glimmer of light appeared among the trunks and the sound
of hurrying water increased in volume. We quickened our
dragging pace, and when Harry pounded violently on the
door of a log building an old man with bent shoulders and
long white hair stood before us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll come in, and very welcome,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I heard
ye coming down the trail. Four men with a load between
them&mdash;where are the lave o&#8217; ye? The best that&#8217;s in
Hector&#8217;s shanty is waiting ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an air of dignity about him which struck
me, and I had heard prospectors and surveyors talk about
mad Hector of the crossing. When we carried our burden
in he knelt and laid back Ormond&#8217;s under jacket of deerskin
before he saw to the broken leg with a dexterity that evinced
a knowledge of elementary surgery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this going to be the end of me?&#8221; asked Ormond
languidly, and the old man, turning his head, glanced
toward me in warning as he answered: &#8220;That&#8217;s as the Lord
wills. Yere friends will need to be careful. The leg&#8217;s no
set that ill, but I&#8217;m suspecting trouble inside o&#8217; ye. With
good guidance ye should get over it. Lay him gently
yonder while I slip on a better lashing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>He crammed the stove with fuel until the hot pipe
trembled to the draught, and soon set a bounteous meal
before us&mdash;fresh venison and smoked salmon with new bread
and dried berries&mdash;while he also prepared a broth for Ormond,
who drank a little greedily, and then lapsed into
slumber. I was for pushing on after a brief rest, but Hector
thought differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither man nor horse has been drowned while I kept
this crossing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and by the help o&#8217; Providence no
man will. Can ye no hear the river roaring to the boulders,
and would ye have her wash ye out mangled out o&#8217; human
image into the bottomless pool? Maybe ye&#8217;ll no like
the passage in the light o&#8217; dawn, but ye cannot cross till
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with a tone of certainty, and knowing that
only those who live by them can predict the eccentric rise
and fall of these torrents I was glad to defer to his judgment.
It was only for Ormond&#8217;s sake that we desired to
press on at all, and Harry observed truthfully, &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
do the poor fellow any good to drown him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was late, but we still loitered about the stove, and
when once the old man stood in the open doorway glancing
toward the foaming rush of the river that I could see beyond
him, as though to gauge its force by the roar which now
filled the room, one of the party remarked: &#8220;Old Hector&#8217;s a
curious critter, with a kink inside his brain, but there&#8217;s
many a free miner owes a big debt to him. He knows
each trick of the river; the Siwash say it talks to him,
and when he says clear passage I guess you can cross. I&#8217;ve
heard that the Roads and Trails Authorities allow him a few
dollars subsidy, but he doesn&#8217;t stay here for that. He was
mixed up in some ugly doings in the gold days, and reckons
he&#8217;s squaring it by keeping the crossing. And I guess
he comes pretty near doing it, too, for there&#8217;s a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
many lives to his credit, if that counts for anything, and
I&#8217;m figuring it does.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ceased as our host returned and said, &#8220;She&#8217;s falling
half-a-foot an hour, an&#8217; for the sake of the sick man I&#8217;ll
see ye over with the break of dawn. Got hurt on the gold
trail&mdash;ye need not tell me. There&#8217;s no a sand bar or gully
from Fraser till Oominica Hector did not travel thirty years
ago. They came up in their thousands then, an&#8217; only the
wolf an&#8217; eagle ken where the maist o&#8217; them lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said the grizzled prospector. &#8220;I was in
the last of it when Caribou was played out and we struck
for the Peace country and Cassiar,&#8221; and Hector stared past
him through the smoke wreaths with vacant eyes that
seemed to look far back into bygone years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was red gold to be had for the seeking then,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We won it lightly, an&#8217; we spent it ill. Ay
wine an&#8217; cards, an&#8217; riot&#8217; when they brought the painted
women in, until the innocent blood was spilt, and Hector
came down from Quesnelle with the widow&#8217;s black curse
upon him&mdash;but it was his partner shot Cassell in the
back. The widow&#8217;s curse; and that&#8217;s maybe why Mary
Macdonal&#8217; lies long years her lone among the hills o&#8217;
Argyle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us how you cleaned out the Hydraulic Company,
Hector,&#8221; said the prospector, and added aside to me, &#8220;I&#8217;m
switching him off onto another track. He&#8217;s not cheerful
on this one, and it&#8217;s hardly fair play to listen while he gives
himself away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then we heard true stories of the old mad days, tales
of grim burlesque and sordid tragedy, which have never
been written, and would not be credited if they were,
though their faint echoes may still be heard between the
Willow River and Ashcroft on the Thompson. Long afterward
when Harry and I discussed that experience he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
&#8220;Say little about Hector; one must know these mountains
well to understand him. I never saw any one quite like him.
He spoke like a Hebrew prophet, and we obeyed him as
though he were an emperor.&#8221;</p>
<p>I slept in a splendid dry blanket under a bearskin which
Hector spread over me, and a dim light was in the eastern
sky when the old man roused me, saying, &#8220;If ye are stout
at the paddle we&#8217;ll try the river noo.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others were growling drowsily as they rose to
their feet, and I saw that Ormond&#8217;s gaze was fixed on
me meaningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take me over now won&#8217;t you, Lorimer?&#8221; he said
as I bent over him. &#8220;I feel that each hour is precious, and
I&#8217;m longing above all things to see Miss Carrington before
I go. It is for her own sake partly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had forgotten our rivalry, and my voice was thick as
I promised, while Ormond sighed before he answered
faintly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been different, Lorimer. It&#8217;s a pity we
didn&#8217;t know each other better three years ago.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>ORMOND&#8217;S LAST JOURNEY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Launch her down handy. Bring the sick man
along!&#8221; called some one outside; and when we
carried Ormond out I saw the others running a big Siwash
canoe down over the shingle, and the dark pines rising
spires of solid blackness against the coming day. It was
bitterly cold, and white mist hung about them, while huge
masses of rock rose through the smoke of the river, whose
clamor filled all the hollow. None of us quite liked the task
before us, for man&#8217;s vigor is never at its highest in the
chilly dawn; but I remembered Ormond&#8217;s eagerness to continue
the journey. So we laid him gently on our blankets
in the waist, and thrust out the long and beautifully modeled
craft, which was of the type that the coastwise Siwash use
when hunting the fur seals. I knelt grasping the forward
paddle until Hector, who held the steering blade, said: &#8220;If
ye&#8217;ll follow my bidding I&#8217;ll land ye safe across. Together!
Lift her all!&#8221;</p>
<p>The light shell surged forward to the sturdy stroke, for
several of those behind me were masters of the paddle, and
as I plied my blade I felt with a thrill that it was good to
fight the might of the river in such a company. Snowy
wreaths boiled high about the shearing prow, I could hear
the others catch their breath with a hiss, and once more after
a heavy thud the cedar floor seemed to raise itself beneath me
and leap to the impulse, while, with a hardening of every
muscle, I swept the leaf-shaped blade outward ready for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
dip. There was spray in my eyes, and bearing down on us
through it a boulder, with dim trunks opening and closing
beyond; then I saw only the bird&#8217;s head on the prow, for
some one cried behind that my stroke was slow, and by the
rush of foam and the shock of thudding blow I knew that
the others&#8217; blades were whirling like flails.</p>
<p>The rock loomed nearer, the river piled against its
battered feet, and I hazarded a glance over my shoulder,
which showed me a row of set faces turned toward the
bow, with stout arms and the flats of redwood blades swung
out before them, until with a swing of shoulders the heads
went down, and a white wave burst apart before the stern.
Looking forward the next instant I saw that the rock lay
right athwart our way; but the others had blind confidence
in our pilot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back ye on the up-stream; drive her yere hardest,
down!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>Then the current strove to wrest my dipped blade
away, as with the paddles on one side held fast by sinewy
wrists the craft turned as on a pivot, and lurching on the
backwash whirled past the stone, after which the cry was:
&#8220;Drive her all!&#8221; and we shot away on the eddy with our
faces turned slantwise up-stream. This was well, for close
below the whole weight of the current hurled itself in fury
upon a ragged barrier, and I understood that Hector had
calculated our impetus to a quarter fathom. There was a
fight to reach the landing, and with any other than the
crew behind me the river might have won; but four of the
lean hard men had fought many such battles, and though
the trunks raced up-stream we closed with the shore until
the shock of the bows on shingle flung me backward.</p>
<p>Our next proceeding was to portage a smaller craft
several hundred yards up the river, for Hector to make the
return passage, and then, as we thanked him for the food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
and the small comforts for Ormond that he forced on us,
the old man said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re very welcome, an&#8217; I&#8217;m not wanting yere dollars.
Will I take payment for a bit of dried venison, when the
Almighty freely gives me all the good fish in the river an&#8217;
the deer in the woods? Go, an&#8217; haste ye; yon man is needing
the aid of science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned away, and watched us from the shingle
as we took up Ormond&#8217;s litter, and the last that we ever
saw of him was a tall lonely figure which vanished into the
gray smoke of the river as we plodded up the climbing trail.
Still, even now, that lonely figure rises up before me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Hector tells strange things when the fit takes him.
Used to speak our language&mdash;it&#8217;s curious, he talks like some
of them emigrants from the old country now,&#8221; a man beside
me said. &#8220;But you can stake your last dollar he isn&#8217;t mad.
No, sir, it&#8217;s quaint he is. I&#8217;ve had my voyageur training in
the frozen country under the H. B. C, but when it&#8217;s dead
knowledge of a rapid he&#8217;ll beat me easy. Some day the
river will get him, and then we&#8217;ll miss him bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>In due time we reached a shingle-roofed settlement,
where a man who had some local reputation for skill in
healing horses examined our companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s pretty well played out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ship him
straight down to Vancouver in a sleeping-car, and don&#8217;t you
let any of them bush-doctors get their claws on him. I
know when a job&#8217;s too big for me, and this is one. You&#8217;ll
fetch up in time for the Pacific mail if you start now in a
wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did that fellow say?&#8221; asked Ormond, and when
I judiciously modified the horse-doctor&#8217;s verdict he smiled
understandingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a wise man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I can guess what
he told you. Lorimer, I know I&#8217;m sinking fast, and if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
leave me here I&#8217;ll die before you can send a doctor up.
Probably I&#8217;ll also die in Vancouver, but every man is justified
in making a fight for his life&mdash;and there&#8217;s another
reason why I should get there first.&#8221;</p>
<p>We hired a light wagon, for a passable trail led to the
railroad, and perhaps because time was scanty, or the jolting
of the wagon was more trying than the swing of the litter,
our patient grew worse, and I was thankful at last to see
him safe in a berth of the sleeper on the Pacific express.
I had grown almost as impatient as Ormond, and I recollect
nothing of the journey except that when the lights of Port
Moody glittered across the forest-shrouded inlet he said:
&#8220;Lorimer, I&#8217;ve a stupid prejudice against a hospital. Please
take me to Wilson&#8217;s instead. He lives alone, and I did him
several services&mdash;you can tell him that it will not be for
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when we reached the station Harry volunteered to
find the best doctor in the timber city&mdash;for hewn stone had
only begun to replace sawn lumber then&mdash;and arrange for
transit to Wilson&#8217;s house; because he said that it was my particular
duty to tell Colonel Carrington and Grace. An
hour passed before I traced them, and then I found them at
a function given to celebrate the starting of some new public
enterprise, and it was with hesitation that, followed by Calvert,
I entered the vestibule of the brilliantly lighted hall.
We gave a message to a bland Chinese attendant, and waited
until returning he beckoned us through a crimson curtain,
which swung to behind, and I found myself standing bewildered
under a blaze of light in a ball-room.</p>
<p>There was a crash of music, a swishing of colored dresses,
and then, as the orchestra ceased, we stood before the astonished
assembly just as we had left the bush, in tattered fur
wrappings and torn deerskin, with the stains of leagues of
travel on our leggings, while I recollect that a creeper-spike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
on my heel made holes in the polished marquetry. All eyes
were turned toward us.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is considerably more than I bargained for,&#8221;
growled Calvert. &#8220;I feel guiltily like the man who brought
the news to Edinburgh after Flodden. What did you play
this confounded trick upon us for, John?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John savvy Miss Callington,&#8221; said the unblushing Mongolian;
and Calvert added savagely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Then hide us somewhere, and tell her, before I twist
your heathen neck for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I noticed Martin Lorimer moving toward me; but before
he reached us Grace came up, a dazzling vision of beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thankful to see you back safe, Ralph, and hear you
have news for me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Lawrence Calvert, the same
applies to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was bravely done, for few women would have cared
to link themselves publicly with such a gaunt and tattered
scarecrow as I undoubtedly was then; but Grace was born
with high courage and a manner which made all she did
appear right. When Calvert said that he would send for
Colonel Carrington, she calmly placed her hand within my
arm, and added:</p>
<p>&#8220;We will find quietness yonder in the empty supper-room.
You have made me anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, doubtless to the wonder of many citizens&#8217; daughters
and wives, we passed together, a sufficiently striking couple,
across the hall; and when at length we escaped the curious
eyes, Grace held me back at arm&#8217;s length.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look thin and haggard, Ralph,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Something
has happened. Now begin, and tell me clearly all
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not know how to commence, and I proceeded awkwardly
to temporize, though I really meant what I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the fault of that stupid Chinaman, Grace, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
am sorry. It was so courageous of you to come to me before
them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at me with a curious mingling of pride and
humor. &#8220;Am I, then, so little as to fear a few inquisitive
women? And do you fancy that I loved you for your prepossessing
exterior? Now, sir, before you offend me further,
at once begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>I placed a lounge for her, and leaned over it as I said,
&#8220;It is about Geoffrey. We went up prospecting, and found
his party in difficulties. Geoffrey is&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not dead!&#8221; she said with a shudder, clutching the
arms of the chair. And I laid my hand soothingly on one
of hers as I answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but he is hurt, and he is longing to see you. He is
in Vancouver now. Listen, I will tell you about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Geoffrey!&#8221; she said when I had finished, while a
tear glistened on her long lashes. &#8220;Geoffrey, my old playmate!
I can hardly believe it. Ralph, there are very few
like him. He is in all things a true-hearted gentleman.
He stood between us; but how many others would have
played their part so chivalrously when he had the power
through my father to force me to his will. And&mdash;may I
be forgiven for it&mdash;more than once I had hard thoughts of
him. And now he is dying! Take me at once to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly afterward a voice reached us through an open
door. It was Calvert&#8217;s, saying, &#8220;I want you to understand,
sir, that if we had not struck Lorimer&#8217;s camp we should
have starved to death. I saw the accident from a distance,
and again it&#8217;s my firm opinion that he ran the utmost risk to
extricate Ormond. If the latter were my own brother I
should consider myself indebted to him for life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; answered an unseen person, whom
it was easy to recognize as the footsteps drew nearer. &#8220;Still,
one must take precautions; and, as I observed, in the circumstances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
some people might have suspicions. I may say
that, indirectly, Lorimer knew that he would profit by my
partner&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started, and would have risen, burning with wrath,
but Grace&#8217;s clasp held me fast. The next moment her
father and Calvert entered the room. The former glanced
toward us in cold surprise; and then, in a hard, ringing
tone, Grace said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still, I hope, a little charity left in the world.
The reference is hardly becoming. There are others beside
Mr. Lorimer who would benefit, directly, by Geoffrey
Ormond&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have spoken, but she prevented me; and her
father stood for a moment speechless with astonishment.
Grace was a dutiful daughter, and, though he must have
tried her patience hardly now and then, I fancied that this
was the first time she had ever openly defied him; while I
saw that the shaft had gone home. Colonel Carrington
was not, however, to be shaken into any exhibition of feeling,
for he turned to me with his usual chilliness:</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you on your lucky escape,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Calvert has told me. If you are quite ready, Grace, and
will get on your wrappings, we will drive over and visit
the sick man immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, seeing that my presence was by no means desired, I
saluted the Colonel with stiffness, and hurried on foot in
the direction of Wilson&#8217;s house. He was a bachelor, it
appeared, who dealt in mining gear, and during their business
intercourse had made friends with Ormond. Now
he was absent inland, but his housekeeper had placed the
pretty wooden dwelling at our patient&#8217;s disposal. What
passed between the latter and Colonel Carrington I do not
know, but when Grace met me on the stairway as I entered
she said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He told us how much you had done for him, and made
my father believe it even against his will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the surgeon came down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do little for him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are internal
injuries&mdash;I needn&#8217;t describe them&mdash;which practically leave
no hope of recovery. You can&#8217;t get a trained woman nurse
for love or money, and it rests between yourselves and a
Chinaman. I fancy that he would prefer you. I don&#8217;t
know how he stood the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did our best, and he was very patient,&#8221; I said. And
the surgeon answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt you did, and it speaks well for your
comrade&#8217;s fortitude. You need not blame yourselves, however,
for from the first he could not have got better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take first watch,&#8221; said Harry, when, after giving us
full instructions, the surgeon departed. &#8220;Miss Carrington
has already insisted on helping. I&#8217;ve sampled Wilson&#8217;s
wardrobe, but his things would split up if you tried to get
into them. Go out and borrow or buy some anywhere.
You can&#8217;t expect to meet Miss Carrington in that most
fantastic disarray. I&#8217;ve taken quarters at the Burrard House,
and it&#8217;s not your turn until to-morrow. The Colonel has
graciously signified his approval of our arrangements.&#8221;</p>
<p>When my watch commenced the next day Ormond seemed
pleased to see me, and Grace, who was spreading southern
flowers in the room, withdrew. Then Calvert and Colonel
Carrington came in with a lawyer, and I raised Ormond so
that he could see them. Outside, and not far below the
window, bright sunlight beat down upon the sparkling inlet,
and across it the mountains rose in a giant wall. Ormond
glanced at them and sighed. Then he said with slow distinctness:</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it down in your own fashion. This is the gist
of it: I, Geoffrey Ormond, being now at least perfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
sound in mind, bequeath my gray horse at Day Spring, all
my guns and rifles, with my silver harness and two pedigree
hunters at Carrington, to Ralph Lorimer, in token of friendship
and gratitude for a courageous attempt at my rescue
when by accident I fell from a rock. I especially desire
this inserted, Mr. Solicitor. You quite understand what I
am saying, Colonel Carrington?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a significant smile in his eyes as they met
mine, and something rose in my throat threatening to choke
me when he added aside: &#8220;You will accept these things
as a memento of our last march, I hope? With this exception,
I bequeath my property in stocks and lands of all
and every kind&mdash;I do not enumerate, or appoint other
executor&mdash;to Colonel Carrington of Carrington Manor, the
balance remaining after his death to revert to his daughter
Grace. Set it all out in due form, and give me the paper
to sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remembering what Grace once told me I fancied that an
expression of unutterable relief smoothed out the wrinkles
of anxiety on the legatee&#8217;s brow, but I may have been mistaken
in this. There was a curious look in Ormond&#8217;s face,
and I understood the depth of his loyalty to Grace. It
struck me with a shock that Ormond, in spite of his apparent
carelessness, realized how far matters had drifted,
and hoped to spare her the painful discovery. Then he lay
back struggling for breath, when, after the will was signed,
at a signal from the doctor the others withdrew. Perhaps an
hour passed while I kept watch alone before he spoke again,
saying very faintly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange, Lorimer, that circumstances should constitute
you my protector. It&#8217;s not the usual ending of a
very old story. A rich man and a poor man loved the same
woman, and&mdash;this is where the strangeness happens, perhaps
because of all women she was most worthy to be loved&mdash;she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
looked kindly upon the poorer man. The other had all
that fortune could give him save what he most desired, and
being older he waited patiently, trusting her heart would
turn toward him, and when at last he learned the truth he
had not courage to give her up, but waited still, hoping, he
hardly knew for what, against hope. Then circumstances
held them closer together in a bond that even for her sake
he dare not break, until at last the knot was cut. Lorimer,
we fought it out fairly, you and I. Now you have won,
and I am dying. I only ask you to be good to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned my head aside, for I could say nothing appropriate,
and he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like you to keep those rifles, and when some day
Grace receives the reversion she will find it but little. We
made some heavy losses in joint ventures, her father and I&mdash;you
will tell her to remember that. I think now all is settled.
God bless her!&#8221;</p>
<p>He slept or lay quite still for some time, and once more,
knowing what I knew, I wondered at the greatness of his
nature, for it was evident that, realizing that his love was
hopeless, he had stood by her father only to serve her. Then
he said feebly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lift me a little, Lorimer, so that I can see the moonrise
on the snow. Before another nightfall I shall have followed
your partner on the unknown trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>I raised him on the pillows, and then sat by the window,
from which&mdash;because the lamp that tired his eyes had been
turned very low&mdash;I could see the shimmer of stars on the
dark breast of the inlet, which was wrapped in shadow, and
a broad band of silver radiance grow wider across the heights
of snow, until Grace came in softly with more blossoms
from sunny Mexico.</p>
<p>Ormond saw her, and he had probably forgotten me,
for there was a great longing in his voice as he said huskily:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
&#8220;Will you kiss me, Grace, for the first and last time since
we were innocent children?&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent over him a compassionate figure, etherealized
by the pale light that touched her through the eastern window,
and I went out and waited on the stairway until, after
the surgeon went in, she passed me, sobbing, and stilled an
expression of sympathy with a lifted hand. That was the
last I saw of Geoffrey Ormond in this life, for when next I
looked at him he lay very white and still with the seal of
death upon him, and I knew that a very clean and chivalrous
soul had gone to its resting-place. I touched his cold forehead
reverently, and then turned away, mourning him,
heaven knows, sincerely, and feeling thankful that when
tempted sorely I had kept my promise that day in the bush
as I remembered his words, &#8220;We have fought it out fairly.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE TRIAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Geoffrey Ormond was duly laid to rest in
Canadian soil, and it was long before the disastrous
expedition was mentioned among us. After all, its painful
record was not an unusual one, for even to-day, when
wagon roads have been driven into the mountain-walled
forests where only the bear and wood-deer roamed before,
all who go out on the gold trail do not come home. I was
anxious to return to Fairmead, so that as soon as decency
permitted I called on Colonel Carrington, and though I
longed to challenge what he had said to Calvert, I contented
myself with formally renewing my previous request.</p>
<p>He listened with cold patience, but I did not like his
very quietness, and, though I believe that he sincerely regretted
Ormond&#8217;s death, I fancied that he was looking more
hopeful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that you are again asking too much, and
your request is characterized rather by assurance than by
common sense,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I need not recapitulate my former
reasons, but, in addition to them, I wonder whether you
have read this. As you do not allude to it, you probably
have not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He produced a clipping from a Winnipeg paper, and because
Western journalism is conducted in a refreshingly
frank style of its own, I read with growing resentment the
following paragraph, which, the cutting being still in my
possession, is quoted verbatim. It commenced with the heading,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
&#8220;The prosecutor skipped by the light of the moon,&#8221;
and continued: &#8220;In connection with the recent arrest of
three cattle thieves we have on good authority a romantic
story. The case is meanwhile hanging fire and won&#8217;t go off
because of the mysterious absence of the prosecutor, one
Lorimer of Fairmead, who has vanished from off the prairie,
and will probably not appear again. Circumstances point
to his being one of the frolicsome Lotharios who occasionally
find the old country sultry, and he apparently developed a
tenderness for the wife of one of the prisoners. As a result,
there were complications, and she left her home. The husband
went to seek her on the wide prairie, and some bad man,
after trying to shoot him, threw him into a sloo. We don&#8217;t
know whether this was the prosecutor, but should think so.
Then the husband swore vengeance, and it is supposed
posted the cattle thieves so that they could clean out the
wicked betrayer&#8217;s stock. Now the lawyers are awaiting
their witness, sorrowing, and can&#8217;t find him, while the boys
are saying that if he doesn&#8217;t reappear the accused will get
off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is hardly a desirable certificate of character for my
daughter&#8217;s suitor,&#8221; said Colonel Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe this infamous libel?&#8221; I asked fiercely.
And his thin lips curled as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, I do not&mdash;that is to say, not the whole of it.
But there are others who will; and I can hardly congratulate
you on your generally accepted reputation. That
alone would be a sufficient barrier to an alliance with my
family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you almost made a conditional promise,&#8221; I said,
mastering my wrath. And the Colonel answered lightly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I merely said that we would discuss the affair again; and
we have done so. Several things have transpired in the
meantime, unfortunately for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is nothing but open defiance,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I
made you a certain promise in return, and I kept it. But
I warn you now that I will marry Miss Carrington in spite
of you. As to that clipping, the prosecutor will be found,
and if there is a law in Canada a full apology will be printed
in the journal. I have nothing more to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have said sufficient, and I think you are foolish.
Any legal action will only make a hole in your scanty exchequer.
I wish you good morning,&#8221; and Colonel Carrington
held the door wide open, while, boiling over with fury, I
took myself away.</p>
<p>I have often since then pondered over that interview,
and could only guess at the reason for the Colonel&#8217;s evident
change of front. I do not think it was due to the paragraph;
but if he had some fresh scheme in contemplation we
never learned it, and Colonel Carrington is past all explanations
now.</p>
<p>When I had partly recovered I showed Harry the paper,
and he frowned as he said: &#8220;I always anticipated something
like this; but of course the present is not the time to tell
you so. It rose out of the cattle deal; and you will take
whatever steps you think best at our joint expense. In any
case, we have only the one purse between us. The sooner
you go back the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was good advice, and I proceeded to act on it by telegraphing
up the line for a messenger to ride to Harry&#8217;s camp
and send down any letters that might be waiting, after which
I sought an interview with Grace. She seemed filled with
a wholly unusual bitterness against her father, but made me
promise with some reluctance to wait a few months longer
before deciding on anything definite.</p>
<p>Harry returned forthwith to his post, but I waited until
the mail brought me several letters, reforwarded from Fairmead.
One was a request to call on the police authorities,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
on a date already passed, in connection with the cattle thieves&#8217;
trial, and there were two from the Winnipeg solicitor, in the
latter of which he said: &#8220;I cannot understand your reticence,
and must state that your mysterious absence tends to
confirm unpleasant rumors about your character. It may
also involve you in legal difficulties, and I trust you will at
once communicate with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran to the telegraph office, and, after sending a message,
&#8220;Expect me by first express,&#8221; I found Martin Lorimer, to
whom I had given an account of my interview with the
Colonel, waiting in my quarters. He, too, possessed a copy
of the wretched paper, and, flinging it down before me, said,
&#8220;Hast seen this, lad? A lie, you needn&#8217;t tell me&mdash;it&#8217;s a
black lie. But there&#8217;s folks that will believe it, for the same
story once deceived me. You&#8217;ll go straight back and sue
them. I&#8217;m coming too. We&#8217;ll make them retract it or
break them, if there&#8217;s justice in the land. Alice has gone
south to California with a big railroad man&#8217;s wife, and I&#8217;m
longing for something to do. There&#8217;s another matter.
Ralph, I&#8217;ve seen the Colonel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen Colonel Carrington?&#8221; I said with dismay. And
Martin Lorimer answered dryly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I&#8217;ve seen him, and had a plain talk with him. Nay,
I&#8217;m not going to tell thee now what I said; but it bit, and
he didn&#8217;t like it. Ralph, lad,&#8221;&mdash;and he nodded toward me
with a chuckle&mdash;&#8220;his daughter&#8217;s worth the winning. My
own girl says so; and thou shalt have her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Lorimer was hard to turn aside from any object
on which he had set his mind&mdash;but so, as everybody knew,
was Colonel Carrington&mdash;and I fear that I abused him inwardly
for a meddling fool, and reflected on the necessity
for deliverance from the blunders of well-meaning friends.
The harm was done, however; and it was useless to attempt
to draw particulars as to his intentions from my uncle, so I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
tried to forget the matter. All he would say was, &#8220;Wait
and thee will see,&#8221; or, again, with a wise shake of his head
in the broad mill parlance, &#8220;Thou never knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>We boarded the next train for Winnipeg, and, after calling
on the solicitor and the police authorities, who eventually
accepted my explanations, the former accompanied us to the
newspaper offices. The chief of the staff seemed surprised
when the solicitor introduced me.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Ralph Lorimer to whom you referred to
in a recently published paragraph,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The other
gentleman is his uncle, a British capitalist; and after he has
given his version of the affair I have something to say. Will
you state the main facts briefly, Mr. Lorimer?&#8221;</p>
<p>I did so, and the newspaper man&mdash;who, I think, was an
American by birth&mdash;made notes.</p>
<p>Then, before the solicitor could intervene, Martin
Lorimer, drawing down his bushy eyebrows, said, in the
unaccented English he used when in a deliberately dangerous
mood, &#8220;You have given out a false impression of an
honest man&#8217;s character. Now you&#8217;re going to publish a true
one, with a full apology, or we intend to make you suffer.
There is law in Canada, I suppose; and if it costs me sufficient
to buy up three papers, we&#8217;ll carry the case on until we
get our damages or smash you. Understand, I&#8217;m for liberty
of the press, and in my young days I helped to fight for it;
but this is libel; and I think you know my friend yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I do,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;One of the smartest
lawyers in the West. Oh, yes, I know him! See here,
we&#8217;re not great on libel actions in this country. It&#8217;s mighty
hard to get damages for that; and we like our news tasty.
No, all things considered, you would make nothing of it if
you did sue me. Why,&#8221;&mdash;and he smiled on the old man,
who looked as if he were eager to assault him&mdash;&#8220;lots of the
boys would take that kind of paragraph as a compliment. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
would tickle their vanity. We admit the raciness&mdash;we are
proud of it; but we stand for fair play too. Would you
mind telling me what you expect to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t appeal to my client,&#8221; said the solicitor. &#8220;He
has, as you would put it, British prejudices. I don&#8217;t intend
to display all our program, but it includes a visit to your
rivals and the men who finance you. Still, though you
sometimes lay the paint on too thick, I have hitherto found
you well-informed and square; and we should rather you did
the right thing of your own accord.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, I thought, looked honest, and with a shrewd
smile he said, &#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking the right talk. This
paper casts its egis over the innocent. It&#8217;s the friend of the
oppressed, besides all the other good things set down in the
New Year&#8217;s article. But I shouldn&#8217;t like those other fellows
to get hold of that story before we&#8217;ve done with it. The
citizens are interested, and we haven&#8217;t your superstitious
fear of commenting on cases <i>sub judice</i>. No, sir, we&#8217;re
afraid of nothing, and don&#8217;t let British capitalists walk over
us with nails in their boots. Now I&#8217;m going to make reparation
and tell that tale in style, showing up all your
client&#8217;s fine qualities. Want to revise the item? You
couldn&#8217;t do it for ten thousand dollars. We&#8217;re &#8217;way beyond
dictation, and pride ourselves on knowing how our readers
like their news.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a hint from the solicitor I contented myself with a
more definite promise to do me justice. Then as we left
the office, Martin Lorimer turned to the editor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a hand on your imagination,&#8221; he said grimly, &#8220;or
you&#8217;ll see me here again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always glad to meet an interesting Britisher,&#8221; the man
of the pen answered with cheerfulness. &#8220;Come in peace,
and we&#8217;ll regale you on our special cigars; otherwise, my assistant
will stand by with the politicians&#8217; club.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the creature who libeled us!&#8221; said Martin
Lorimer when we reached the street. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to
go back and show him whether I&#8217;m an interesting Britisher&mdash;confound
him!&#8221; whereupon the lawyer laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not all like him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This particular
journal depends on its raciness, and he has to maintain the
character. After all, he is an honest man, and he&#8217;ll do you
justice, though the item may contain specimens of what
passes for local humor.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was apparently the case, for when we read it together
Martin Lorimer grew very red in the face, and at
first I was divided between vexation and amusement. It
ran as follows: &#8220;We have unwittingly cast suspicion on
an innocent man, and for once an unprincipled informant has
fooled us. The cattle-thief prosecutor has appeared, and
will shortly present himself blushing before the public gaze.
We have seen him, and can testify that instead of a Don
Juan he is a Joseph, for there is an air of ingenuous innocence
about him which makes it certain that he would crawl
into a badger-hole if he met a pretty woman on the prairie.
If further proof were wanted, he goes about in charge of a
highly respectable British Cr&oelig;sus, one of the full-crusted
elderly models of virtue they raise in Lancashire. The class
is not obsolete. We have seen one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, with whimsical directness, the following lines set
forth the true state of the case, and I felt on the conclusion
that the writer had not unskillfully reversed his previous unfavorable
version. Martin Lorimer, however, signally failed
to appreciate it, for the words obsolete and full-crusted stuck
in his throat, and I had some difficulty in restraining him
from returning forthwith to the newspaper offices. The
journal eventually languished, and succumbed after some
friction with the authorities when the editor left it to seek
in the great republic a wider field for his talents, but before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
this happened he paid us several friendly visits at Fairmead.</p>
<p>The trial, which excited public interest at the time, took
place shortly afterward. It transpired that there were other
charges of fraud against the pair of thieves, whose case was
hopeless from the beginning, but the prosecution experienced
some difficulty in obtaining evidence to connect Fletcher
definitely with them, though several facts suggested that he
had for some time acted as a tool in their hands. The court
was crammed, and looking down on the sea of faces I could
recognize a number of my neighbors from the Fairmead district
and Carrington, and was not overjoyed to see them.
An attempt to steal a large draft of cattle was an important
event on the prairie. I should not have testified at all, could
this have been avoided, which, however, was not the case, and
I awaited with much anxiety the cross-examination for the
defense, because my solicitor had warned me that as more
latitude was generally allowed than in England an attempt
would be made to arouse popular sympathy on behalf of
Fletcher and shake my evidence by casting doubts on my
character.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any animus against the prisoner Fletcher?&#8221;
was the first question.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Indeed, I was always anxious to
befriend him until he robbed and slandered me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or his wife?&#8221; added the inquisitor. &#8220;I think you
knew her in England. Is it not true that you took her from
the service of a railroad hotel and found a house for her on
the prairie?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a murmur in the court, and objection was
taken to this question by the prosecution, but I was directed
to answer it, so I said as coolly as I could: &#8220;I did know
her in England. She was clerk in my uncle&#8217;s mill, where
Thomas Fletcher assisted the cashier. He was not married
then. I took her from the service of the railroad hotel.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is a damaging admission,&#8221; said my persecutor, and
would have continued before I could finish the answer, but
that there was a commotion below, which I hastened to
profit by, adding, &#8220;But I brought her husband to meet her,
and found him a situation in a creamery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true, every word of it!&#8221; a shrill voice rose up, and
the murmuring grew louder in the body of the court, while
it pleased me to see that the riders of Carrington vied with
our humbler neighbors in this sign of approval. Then some
one sternly called &#8220;Silence!&#8221; and the examination commenced
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must protest against friends of the witness coming
here to create a disturbance,&#8221; said the barrister. &#8220;They are
all owners of cattle, and accordingly filled with prejudice.
This is a court of justice, and not a cow-boy&#8217;s tribunal under
the laws of Lynch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my province,&#8221; interposed the judge, &#8220;and if the
disturbance is repeated I shall know how to deal with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The barrister bowed as he rearranged his papers, and I
felt murderously inclined toward him when, leaning on the
rail in an impressive attitude, he continued: &#8220;I must next
ask the witness whether Mrs. Fletcher did or did not visit
him alone at his house, and remain for some time there?
Also, when her husband most naturally came to inquire for
her, whether he was not threatened with violence, and driven
away at the muzzle of a loaded rifle? I want a direct answer.
Yes or no.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prosecution challenged the necessity for such a question,
but after some verbal fencing between the lawyers and
the judge it was allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first case I was not alone,&#8221; I said, looking straight
at my adversary. &#8220;In the second I was absent, and did not
threaten him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was to your knowledge threatened?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that shortly after leaving your house
he was murderously assaulted as a result of his visit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that some one flung him into a muddy sloo,
and I was not sorry to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is sufficient,&#8221; said the examiner, with a significant
smile toward the jury. &#8220;He was threatened with a loaded
rifle for inquiring as to his wife&#8217;s whereabouts; then murderously
assaulted. Next you work up this charge against him.
You may sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>I understood that the judge made some comments here,
but I was too savage to hear clearly, and scarcely caught
what followed next, until Jasper was placed on the witness
stand, and stated that he had given no authority to any one
except myself to sell the cattle, which he swore to, with
other details which were not particularly interesting. There
was no doubt that Fletcher was at least obstinately defended,
for the lawyer once more strove skillfully to twist out answers
confirming the theory that his client had no direct connection
with the affair, and sought to show on my part a
deliberate intention to ruin him. He may even have believed
the romantic story, which was particularly calculated
to appeal to a Western jury.</p>
<p>Jasper&#8217;s replies did not, however, help him much, for
when, returning to the subject, he asked, &#8220;Did you not on
several occasions drive the witness Lorimer over to Fletcher&#8217;s
dwelling with presents for his wife?&#8221; Jasper answered
boldly, &#8220;I did, and I guess Mrs. Fletcher would have gone
hungry if we hadn&#8217;t. Fletcher&#8217;s a low-grade wastrel, and
anyway he ate most of them presents. Yes, sir; they were
fowls and potatoes, and Lorimer never went over but
Fletcher was there.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a great laugh from the riders of Carrington,
and the defendant&#8217;s lawyer frowned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a friend of the witness Lorimer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; Jasper answered simply. &#8220;If ever I meet
you on the prairie I&#8217;ll endeavor to convince you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you a friend of Thomas Fletcher&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer was emphatic. &#8220;No. I guess the sight of
the insect makes me sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the lawyer smiled toward the jury, and the judge,
censuring the witness, directed him to refrain from unnecessary
details. The next question came:</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it because you were a friend of Lorimer&#8217;s, or had
such a bitter dislike to Fletcher, that one night you attempted
to murder him? Let me remind you that Fletcher, as has
been admitted, came to bring back his wife from Fairmead,
and was threatened with a rifle there. Then you rode
after him, and overtook him on the prairie where it was
lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was for neither reason,&#8221; Jasper answered, straightening
his burly form as he glared at his adversary. &#8220;A young
girl bluffed off Fletcher and the other ruffian there, the
prisoner Gorst. She was alone, but she scared the pair of
them with an empty rifle. Suppose you left your sister
alone, and came back to find a half-drunk hobo trying to
murder her?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer, I fancied, had now heard rather more than
he knew before, and it struck me that the prisoner&#8217;s cunning
had overreached itself in not posting him better, for he
glanced at his papers before continuing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you make a violent attack upon him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Jasper, cheerfully. &#8220;Oh, yes, and I&#8217;m
coming to it in my own way. I rode right after him, took
Fletcher out of the wagon, asked the other man if he felt inclined
to assist him, and, when he didn&#8217;t, laid into Fletcher
with the whip and just hove him into the sloo. Why did
I do it?&mdash;it&#8217;s a poor conundrum. For the credit of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
prairie. We&#8217;ve no room for woman-beaters, cattle thieves,
slanderers, and dishonest lawyers down to our district.
Bring along more questions&mdash;you hear me; I&#8217;ve lots more
to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge cut short his eloquence, but he had said enough,
and there was wild approval from the prairie contingent, in
which some of the citizens joined, and through it Jasper
towered before the assembly, a stalwart figure, shaking a
great fist and ejaculating something in the direction of his
annoyer. The tumult was quelled with difficulty, and an
official told me that never before had he seen so much excitement
shown. It was due, he added, to the presence of
those mad young riders of Carrington. I sat down breathing
more easily, for I felt that as yet my honor was clear,
and whether Fletcher escaped or not was of minor importance.
From the beginning the main efforts of the other
side had been directed toward saving him, while as the case
proceeded I listened with decreasing interest, until at last
the prosecutor said:</p>
<p>&#8220;My opponent has done his utmost, even overstepping
limits, to prove that the witness Lorimer has ended a long
course of injury by supporting a false charge against the
prisoner Fletcher. This is after all a side issue, but I think
the jury will agree that he has furnished most reliable testimony,
and that the prisoner mentioned took an unprincipled
advantage of his perfectly well-intentioned kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was considerably more which did not affect me,
and another speech, though I woke to eager interest again
when the judge, in making his final comments, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;As regards the witness Lorimer, I entirely agree with the
view taken by the prosecution. He has evidently suffered by
well-meant efforts to aid the prisoner, and, though that is
not connected with the case except in so far as it covers the
reliability of his testimony, he has been shown to be an individual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
of unblemished character. We can accordingly
accept his evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was applause, which the judge checked
severely, and proceeded: &#8220;You will notice that, while the
prisoner Fletcher&#8217;s record does not seem to be a creditable
one, the evidence fails in some degree to connect him with
the other two prisoners as an active participator in the robbery.
I refer to&mdash;&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>The jury retired for a considerable time, and when the
foreman reappeared he announced that they found two of the
prisoners guilty, and Thomas Fletcher not guilty, the latter
in a very doubtful tone. He also appeared desirous of adding
some explanation, which was not permitted; while,
as the court broke up, I noticed the detective watching
Fletcher much as a cat watches a momentarily liberated
mouse. Then I was surrounded by the men from the
prairie, who insisted on escorting us to our hotel, and when
I asked for Jasper somebody said he had seen him loitering
beside one of the court-house doors. We found him partly
hidden by a wagon, watching it intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you getting up another speech, or trying to freeze
there?&#8221; one of the Carrington party asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I guess I&#8217;m laying for that lawyer. Couldn&#8217;t get
at him inside there for a barrier. Am I a low-grade perjurer&mdash;and
my friend what he was working round to show?
If you&#8217;ll stand by for just two minutes I&#8217;ll convince the insect&mdash;the
blamed, vermilion, mosquito!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too late,&#8221; said the man from Carrington. &#8220;He
went out the other way some time ago. Mr. Lorimer, one
or two of us were at first&mdash;appearances were strongly
against you, you know&mdash;inclined to doubt you, and we feel
considerably ashamed of ourselves. We want you and your
worthy uncle to join us at dinner. Got together the best
company we could to meet you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>It was honestly said, and we accepted with willingness,
while I think my worthy uncle enjoyed himself even more
than I did. He was a jealous insular Briton, and the sight
of those sturdy handsome young Englishmen who well maintained
the credit of the old land in the new delighted him.
The appreciation seemed to be mutual. He complained of a
headache the next morning; but that dinner had conferred on
the Radical cotton-spinner the freedom of aristocratic Carrington,
and an indefinite but valuable intimation that the
colony had set its special endorsement upon his nephew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE ROAD TO DAKOTA</h3>
</div>

<p>Martin Lorimer returned to Vancouver promptly,
for he found the prairie cold trying, and by-and-by I
received a letter from Harry still reporting profitable work,
in which he said: &#8220;Your uncle seems to have developed a
craze for real estate. Buying land on a rising town boom is
a somewhat risky amusement, especially if, as they express
it here, the bottom drops out of the boom; but I suppose he
can afford it, and he has been trailing around lately with
two surveyors behind him. Laid hands on the timber lots
about the Day Spring, which is sending up very low-grade,
ore. Perhaps you know, though he won&#8217;t tell any one,
why he is doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I showed the letter to Aline, and she looked remarkably
wise; then, putting her head on one side, she nodded twice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a great respect for Uncle Martin&#8217;s sagacity,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;He&#8217;s planning something for the benefit of Colonel
Carrington, and I&#8217;ve a faint inkling of what it may be. But
don&#8217;t worry me with questions. He won&#8217;t show a single
person what he means to do until he is ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no ideas at all on the subject, though I did not tell
Aline so. For her age she was rather too vain of her superior
perception, and it struck me as becoming that a younger sister
should look up to her brother. I was proud of Aline, but
she had her failings.</p>
<p>It was not long afterward, when returning from Jasper&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
at night, I found the remains of a meal on the table, and my
sister waiting with news for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t come home earlier, Ralph,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I am quite ashamed of my inconsistency. It&#8217;s nice
to think oneself inflexible, isn&#8217;t it? And then it&#8217;s humiliating
to resolve on a certain course and do the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, either to excite my curiosity or to afford an
opportunity for considering the sentiment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind all that. Come to the point, Aline,&#8221; I
said. But she stirred the stove, and dusted some plates that
did not require it, before she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I had made up my mind to hate Mrs. Fletcher forever,
and, do you know, I let her kiss me scarcely half an hour
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Minnie here again! Oh, confound her!&#8221; I said, banging
back my chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wicked to lose your temper, Ralph,&#8221; Aline answered
sweetly, &#8220;and very unbecoming in an elder brother. It isn&#8217;t
poor Minnie&#8217;s fault that her husband is what you call a bad
egg, is it? Yes, she came here in a sleigh with two tired
horses, and one was lame. She was going to meet her husband
somewhere. He has become a teetotaler, and promises
to turn out quite a virtuous character. She hinted at something
which I didn&#8217;t know about that happened at the trial&mdash;it
was too bad of you to burn those papers&mdash;and said he was
going to Dakota, across the border. She was almost frozen,
had only fall clothes on, and she was very hungry. It
wouldn&#8217;t have been right to let her face an all-night drive in
Arctic weather like that, and she put the horses into the
stable, while I lent her all my wrappings, gave her food to
take, and made her rest and eat. She said she felt she must
call and tell me how very sorry she was. Then she cried on
my head, and I let her kiss me. We should always be forgiving,
Ralph, shouldn&#8217;t we?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Fletcher reformed!&#8221; I said astonished. &#8220;Oh,
how foolish you women are! I&#8217;ve only met one who is always
sensible;&#8221; and then an idea struck me, and I added
quickly: &#8220;Are you quite sure Fletcher wasn&#8217;t in the
sleigh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Fletcher wasn&#8217;t there&mdash;at least, I&#8217;d had neuralgia,
so I only looked out of the window. Minnie put up the
horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I flung open a cupboard door, and what I saw confirmed
a growing suspicion. For legal reasons whisky is
scarce on portions of the prairie, but a timely dose of alcohol
has saved many a man&#8217;s life in the Canadian frost, and we always
kept some spirits in case of emergency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Minnie is not a teetotaler,&#8221; I said. &#8220;A bottle of
whisky has gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving Aline to consider this, I ran to the stable, and
found that one of the splendid horses poor Ormond had
bequeathed me was also gone. In its place stood a sorry
beast, evidently dead lame, and it did not need the scrap of
paper pinned to the manger to explain the visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am running a heavy risk, and you won&#8217;t betray me,&#8221;
the pencil scrawl read. &#8220;Tetley of Coul√©e Rouge will send
back the horse and robes. It is a last favor; we won&#8217;t
trouble you any more.&mdash;Minnie Fletcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was troubled, however. We should need every available
beast in the spring, and Tetley was rather more than
suspected of being concerned in smuggling whisky and certain
contraband commerce, including the shipping of Chinamen
over the United States border. It seemed like tempting
Providence to leave a horse of that kind in his hands,
and yet Coul√©e Rouge was twenty long miles away. I was
also considerably puzzled as to why Minnie should have interfered
to save her husband, for it was evident some fresh
charge had been brought against him, and he was seeking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
safety in the republic. Extradition existed, but except in
murder cases it was not often that a fugitive who had once
crossed the boundary was ever brought back. It seemed impossible
that she had not read the reports in the papers, and
the charge Fletcher brought against her was a hard one to
forgive. Still, papers were not plentiful on the prairie, and
the people she lived with might out of kindness have concealed
part of the news from her. However that might be,
I determined to save the horse, and explained this to Aline,
with a brotherly warning not to allow emotion to get the
better of her judgment in future. She listened with a
docility that promised future reprisals, and then, agreeing
that it would be well to secure the horse, said that she should
not mind being left alone. Indeed, unless something very
unexpected happened, she would be as safe alone at Fairmead
as in any town.</p>
<p>So I saddled the next best horse, donned my warmest skin
coat, and started for a cold ride across the prairie. The
snow was thin and fairly hard&mdash;it seldom lies deep about
Fairmead; but in view of the return journey I did not urge
the horse, and our sleigh had lost a runner. So when perhaps
half the distance had been traversed a beat of hoofs
grew louder behind me, and four horsemen, riding hard,
came up. By the jingle of accouterments I knew they were
the wardens of the prairie, and half expected what was to
follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up!&#8221; the sharp summons came, while I recognized
my old acquaintance, Sergeant Angus, as the speaker.
&#8220;Lorimer o&#8217; Fairmead&mdash;good night to ye. Have ye seen
a two-horse sleigh? We&#8217;ve news of it passing Green Hollow,
south-bound, four hours ago!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom are you wanting?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas Fletcher,&#8221; the sergeant answered. &#8220;One of his
late partners gave him away, and there&#8217;s a warrant for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
They wired us on to watch the stations, and a message came
from Elktail that he&#8217;d been seen heading south in a sleigh.
He&#8217;s no friend o&#8217; yours; have ye met that sleigh, and where
are ye riding at this unholy hour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen the sleigh; but a woman
drove up to Fairmead, where my sister was alone, and borrowed
my best horse. There are some business friends of
yours on the trail to Dakota, and I&#8217;m going south in case
they took a fancy to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re wise,&#8221; said Sergeant Angus. &#8220;A woman, are ye
sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister was sure, and she ought to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite understanding this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but meantime
Thomas Fletcher is skipping for the boundary. Ride
ye, boys, ride!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was thankful for the diversion, for I could not see my
way clearly, and as we pressed on there was small opportunity
for awkward questions. I wanted the horse and
meant to get it, but that would have contented me, and I
had no desire to assist in the capture of Fletcher. Another
hour passed, and then far away on the edge of the white
circle, which was lighted by the rays of a sinking moon, I
saw a moving speck, and one of the troopers shouted.
Thereupon the spurs went in, and when my beast shot forward
I knew that the police horses were tired, and I could
readily leave them behind. Still, I was not an officer of the
law, and reflecting that my presence or absence would in no
way affect the fugitives&#8217; chance of escape, while after recent
events it was well to be careful, I held him in.</p>
<p>We were gaining, however, for the distant object developed
into a sleigh; but the moon was sinking fast, and the
dark line on the horizon, with a fretted edge, betokened the
birches fringing Coul√©e Rouge, where the party before us
might well escape.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ride ye, boys!&#8221; cried the sergeant; but the beasts were
weary and the blundering gallop was a poor one, while I
kept a firm hand on the good horse&#8217;s rein, holding him behind
the others and out of sight, lest Sergeant Angus should
demand an exchange in the Queen&#8217;s name. This was not
easy, for Ormond had hunted coyotes on him with a very
scratch pack of hounds, while one of the troopers kept dropping
back toward me, and the beast seemed under the impression
that I was wilfully throwing away my chance in the
race. Meanwhile, the sleigh grew more and more visible,
though I did not doubt that its occupants were doing their
utmost to gain the shelter of the birches in the dark coul√©e,
and that my other horse was suffering at their hands accordingly.
Then there was a growl from the sergeant as the
sleigh was lost on the edge of the fringe of trees, and
presently we rode panting and more slowly beneath them,
to the brink of the coul√©e, with the steam from the horses
rising in white clouds about us. It was, of course, particularly
steep, and as the moonlight only filtered through the
matted branches dark shadow for the most part veiled the
treacherous descent, which the troopers accomplished with
many a stumble. They were excellent horsemen, but there
is a limit to equine endurance, and their beasts had nearly
reached it. Presently, as we neared the very rude log bridge
which spanned the inevitable creek, the last silvery patch of
radiance faded, and thick darkness filled the ravine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;Confusion! It&#8217;s pit
dark!&#8221; and drawing rein we sat still a few moments, listening
intently, but we heard only the branches moaning under
the bitter breeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two trails,&#8221; said Sergeant Angus. &#8220;Yon one
up the other side leads south away for Dakota; this follows
the coul√©e to Jake Tetley&#8217;s. Tom, ye&#8217;re proud o&#8217; your
tracking, ride on to Tetley&#8217;s, an&#8217;, for Jake&#8217;s good at lyin&#8217;,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
look well for the scrape o&#8217; runners if he swears he has not
seen them. Finding nothing, if ye strike southeast over the
rises, ye&#8217;ll head us off on the Dakota trail. I&#8217;m thinking
they&#8217;re hurrying that way for the border, and we&#8217;ll wait for
ye by the Blackfoot ridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rubbed a fizzing sulphur match into sickly flame; but,
as the banks were steep, and that bridge formed a favorite
crossing, the snow showed the recent passage of many runners,
and there was nothing to be learned from them. The
wood was thicker than usual, and from what we could see
there was no way a sleigh could traverse it quickly except by
the two trails. So the trooper departed for Tetley&#8217;s dwelling,
which lay some distance up the coul√©e, while we breasted
the opposite slope and proceeded more slowly through the
darkness across the plain. Half an hour later we waited
a while on the crest of one of the gradual rises which are common
thereabout, until presently a hail answered the sergeant&#8217;s
cry, and the trooper rejoined us.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve not been near Tetley&#8217;s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Must have
pushed on straight ahead of us. I made him bring a lantern,
and prospected down the trail, but nothing on four legs has
come up it for a week at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you think they have gone?&#8221; I asked, and the
sergeant answered wearily:</p>
<p>&#8220;The deil knows, but it will be south. Weel, we have
our orders, an&#8217; their cattle are failing, while even if we miss
them we&#8217;ll strike their trail by daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m anxious about my
horse, but I can&#8217;t go any further to-night. He&#8217;s a big chestnut,
branded small O inside the Carrington C. You&#8217;ll be
careful with him, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On with ye, boys,&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;A fair passage
home, Mr. Lorimer; I&#8217;m envying ye a warm seat by the
stove to-night,&#8221; and the mounted figures disappeared into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
the gloom, while more leisurely I headed back toward the
coul√©e. Orders were orders with the Northwest Police,
and though they had ridden under Arctic cold most of the
day they must also spend the night in the saddle if the horses
could keep their footing much longer, which, however,
seemed doubtful. The search might last several days, and I
could not leave Aline so long, while a Brandon man of business
had arranged to call on me the next afternoon, and I
knew that if the troopers came upon it the horse would be
in good hands. Still, the police at least were strong men,
and I rather pitied Minnie Fletcher slowly freezing in the
bitter darkness under Aline&#8217;s furs. I was glad now that she
had lent them to her. Minnie evidently had not expected
that the troopers, being warned by telegraph, would take up
the trail so soon.</p>
<p>Then for the first time I recollected that Tetley had
been cutting building logs on a more level strip half-way up
the side of the ravine, and had cleared a jumper trail toward
it. The sergeant certainly did not know this, and it struck
me that while his party searched the two forking trails
Fletcher&#8217;s sleigh might well have lain hidden in the blind
one, and I turned the horse&#8217;s head toward Tetley&#8217;s dwelling.
When I neared it my suspicions were confirmed, for a rough
voice hailed me from under the trees:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you wanting, stranger? Stop there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Jim Tetley,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s way down to Dakota, and you can&#8217;t see him,&#8221; the
unseen person said.</p>
<p>To this I replied at a venture: &#8220;I&#8217;m too cold for unnecessary
fooling. Jim Tetley is inside there. Go right in,
and tell him that Lorimer of Fairmead is waiting for his
horse. He&#8217;ll understand that message.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking,&#8221; said the man showing himself.
&#8220;Stay where you are until I come back.&#8221; And when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
returned, he said: &#8220;You can have it on the promise you&#8217;ll
tell no one what you see. It&#8217;s not healthy to break one&#8217;s
bargain, either, with Jim Tetley, while living in a wooden
house with a straw-pile granary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a friend of Mrs. Fletcher, and I&#8217;m in a hurry,&#8221; I
answered boldly, and when he ushered me into the dwelling
I saw what I had expected. Minnie lay back limp and colorless
in a big chair by the stove. Fletcher knelt close beside
her chafing her wrists, and the table was littered with wrappings,
while Tetley frowned at me from one end of the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fletcher,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You and your advocate worked up
a lying charge against me. Shall I ask your wife before
you whether it&#8217;s true? Do you know that in half an hour I
could bring the police on you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Tetley, laying his hand significantly
on the rifle behind him; while Fletcher answered
sullenly, &#8220;You needn&#8217;t. I know now it isn&#8217;t true. But I
was mad, and believed it at first, and afterward it was either
that or five years. There were other counts against me; and
what could a poor man do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Minnie looked at him with disgust, and shivered as she
snatched one of her hands from his grasp. &#8220;It was very
good of your sister, Ralph,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I knew you would
forgive me for borrowing the horse; he is there in the stable,
and Tetley will find Tom another. It was an awful
journey, even before we reached Fairmead, where I hid him
in the bottom of the sleigh; and they brought me in here almost
frozen stiff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she was gone, poor thing!&#8221; said Mrs. Tetley,
who was cooking something on the stove; and her husband
broke in: &#8220;She looked like it. Cuss them police! But we
euchred them. A young trooper rides up to the door and
drives me round prospecting with a lantern. Of course, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
found nothing, and when he rode off I began to tumble.
Found your friends in the log-trail and brought them in,
knowing them blame troopers wouldn&#8217;t come back again.
Sergeant Angus is a smart man, but he doesn&#8217;t know everything,
and I&#8217;ll see Fletcher and his missis safe in the hands
of a friend who will slip them over the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going,&#8221; said Minnie. &#8220;Ralph&mdash;and you all
can listen&mdash;my husband came to me desperate and hopeless
in fear of the law. Oh, it&#8217;s no secret, all the prairie knows
that he used me scandalously&mdash;but he was my husband&mdash;and
I could not give him up. So I took the few dollars I
had and hired the sleigh, and when the horse fell dead lame
we came to Fairmead. I knew, though we had wronged
you, I could trust you. Now he&#8217;s in safe hands; I&#8217;m going
no further with him. There are some things one cannot forget.
I shall tell the story to the people who employed me;
they are kind-hearted folk, but it doesn&#8217;t matter if they give
me up. I&#8217;m sick of this life, and nothing matters now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke out half-sobbing, half-laughing wildly, and
though Fletcher growled something sullenly, hanging his
head with the air of a whipped hound, I fancied that he
seemed relieved at this decision, and was slightly surprised
to see he had even the decency to appear ashamed of himself.
Then, knowing that the people she worked for would do
their best for Minnie, I determined to write to them, and I
asked Tetley to bring out the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I give you a shakedown in the stable until morning?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The missis will look after Mrs. Fletcher,
and see she gets back safe,&#8221; and he added so that the others
could not hear him, &#8220;Fletcher&#8217;s meaner than poison, and I&#8217;d
let the troopers have him and welcome, only for the sake of
the woman, and because he knows enough about some friends
of mine to make things lively if he talked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tetley was of course a rascal, but there was a certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
warped honesty in his dealings with brother rogues&mdash;at
least so rumor said&mdash;and I knew if he had given his promise
he could be trusted, while a few of his perfectly honest neighbors
were sorry when not long afterward Sergeant Angus
proved too sharp for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;My horse would be worth
a great deal in Dakota, and I&#8217;ll clear out while I&#8217;m sure of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Ralph,&#8221; said Minnie, when I donned the fur
cap and mittens. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose I shall ever see you
again&mdash;no, of course you won&#8217;t be sorry; but you and
Jasper were the only two who ever showed me kindness in
this hard, hard country. I wish, oh, how I wish I had never
seen it! Tell my father to forget me, the sooner the better.
I have chosen my own way, and must follow it. It&#8217;s leading
me to prison now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She appeared about to relapse into hysterics, and knowing
that I could not help her at the moment, and might only
make matters worse, I stopped Fletcher with a threatening
gesture as he prepared to address me, and hurried out with
Tetley, who showed me the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll strike Cranton&#8217;s heading, due east by the chain
sloos, in a league,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He deals with us sometimes,
and you needn&#8217;t fear his talking. Don&#8217;t trouble about
Mrs. Fletcher. She&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rode out leading one of the horses, and in due time
reached Cranton&#8217;s, though I nearly beat the door in before
I roused him, and I left him the next morning with his
curiosity unsatisfied. That was the last I ever saw of
Thomas Fletcher. Neither did Sergeant Angus find his
trail, for Tetley knew every foot of the prairie, and enjoyed
the reputation of being unequaled in his own somewhat mysterious
business, which I understood demanded a high proficiency
in evading the watchfulness of the police.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE RECALL OF ADAM LEE</h3>
</div>

<p>When I returned to Fairmead I wrote two letters. One
was to Minnie&#8217;s employer, who kept a flourishing implement
store further down the line, to which he had lately
added a somewhat primitive hotel, in whose management
I understood Minnie assisted. He was an enterprising, good-natured
Manitoban, and everybody spoke well of his wife,
so, having had dealings with him, I requested an interview.</p>
<p>In the other I told Harry all that had passed, asking him
to transmit as much as he thought proper to Lee, and then
awaited developments. The first result was a note from
storekeeper Moran saying that as he was looking up orders
for implements he would call on me, which he did presently,
and proceeded to discuss the matter with frankness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife has taken a fancy to Mrs. Fletcher,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We just call her Minnie because there&#8217;s no particular
reason to handicap her with her husband&#8217;s name. She&#8217;s a
mighty smart honest woman, and we knew that story about
you was a lie from the beginning&mdash;did our best to keep it
from her, but I think she knew. We were startled some
when she lit out with the sleigh, but she came back half-dead,
and we asked no questions until she told us. She&#8217;s
been sick and fretful since, but I guess there&#8217;s nothing you
can do. When we can&#8217;t keep a sick woman who has done
good work for us a while we&#8217;ll give up the business. She&#8217;ll
be pert again directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a very kind man,&#8221; said Aline, glancing at him
critically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, miss,&#8221; Moran answered. &#8220;You just make
your mind easy about Mrs. Fletcher; and now, Lorimer,
we&#8217;ll talk business. You&#8217;ll want a new binder if you&#8217;re
putting in much of a crop, and I&#8217;ve got the latest machines
coming in from Toronto.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline burst into a hearty laugh, in which I joined her,
for the speech was characteristic of the native prairie inhabitants&#8217;
character. Frugal, but open-handed, hard to
beat at a bargain, they are equally swift to seize upon all
chances that lead to business and do the stranger an unostentatious
kindness, though they have no false delicacy in
forthwith establishing commercial relations with the man
they benefit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see any joke!&#8221; said Moran. &#8220;You want a
binder. I&#8217;ve seen the old one, and I&#8217;ve got lots to sell. Of
course we&#8217;ll look after Mrs. Fletcher, but that&#8217;s no reason I
should miss a deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result was that I ordered an expensive binder which
I had hoped to do without, and presently Moran departed
with the order in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he was very sensible,&#8221; said Aline, &#8220;and you
know you said the old machine would hardly have lasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry answered promptly, and said he expected I should
see Lee very soon. He had been restless ever since he heard
of Fletcher&#8217;s blacksliding, and had, among other things,
embarked upon two unpopular crusades. He even seemed
disappointed, Harry added, because there was so little
drunkenness and loose living for him to grapple with.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so like a man,&#8221; said Aline when she read the
letter. &#8220;Where is your boasted consistency? He ought
to be thankful. But you have missed the postscript about
Uncle Martin. This is what Harry says: &#8216;I met him in
long boots one day when I went up to see Calvert, trailing
a survey chain not far from the Day Spring mine, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
I asked him what he was doing it for, and whether snow-slush
was good for lumbago, he smiled and answered in the
silver tongue of your native country something I failed to
comprehend. For a respectable cotton-spinner, as I told
him, he has developed curious ways.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will see by-and-by, and so will that arrogant
Colonel,&#8221; said Aline. &#8220;He has offended him bitterly, and I
shouldn&#8217;t like to be an enemy of Uncle Martin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an interlude of quietness, and then, when at
last the winter showed signs of relaxing its iron grip, and
the snow grew soft at noon, events commenced to follow
fast upon one another. Jasper drove up from the railroad
one afternoon bringing Lee with him, and then departed
with, I thought, undue precipitancy, leaving myself and the
old man alone, for I had increased the accommodation at
Fairmead, and Aline discreetly withdrew. He had of course
read the papers, though not until some time after the trial,
and was good enough to say he never doubted my innocence.
Still, I had to repeat all the unpleasant details, until at last
Aline returned to prepare supper.</p>
<p>Then he sighed as he said: &#8220;It&#8217;s a bad business, but I
feared from the start this would be the end of it. And now
I&#8217;m going to tell thee something. I&#8217;ve served thee and thy
partner as well as I could, and I&#8217;ve saved some money doing
it. It&#8217;s a gradely life up yonder, in spite of the snow and
cold&mdash;ay, I would ask no better than to end my days there,
but it&#8217;s over easy and peaceful in a world that&#8217;s brimming
with misery, and I&#8217;ve been feeling like Jonah when he fled
with his message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline smiled at me over her shoulder, and I stared at
him in amaze, saying, &#8220;I never found it either particularly
easy or peaceful. I don&#8217;t quite understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lee, changing in a moment to his old
pedantic style I had almost forgotten. &#8220;Thou hast not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
the message; it&#8217;s thy work to till the soil, and I had thought
to bide in this good land helping thee until my time came.
But a voice kept on saying, &#8216;Go back to them hopeless
poor and drunkards thou left in Lancashire.&#8217; I would not
listen. The devil whispered I was worn out and done, but
when I talked with Harry, he, not having understanding,
said: &#8216;You&#8217;re looking younger every day. If I heard those
kind of things I should say it was liver.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline no longer smiled, but sat watching him and
listening gravely, and I began to catch a glimmer of his
meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;The folks at chapel had not forgotten me,&#8221; continued
Lee, &#8220;and they were in trouble. There was another man
took up the work I left, but he went off with t&#8217; brass
they&#8217;d gathered for a new gallery, and they wrote they&#8217;d
see I got back the old shop if I come home again. And
because I was weak and fearful o&#8217; the grinding struggle
over there, I did not go. They wrote another letter, but
still I bided, until I read this paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spread out a soiled English journal, and, running a
crooked finger across it, read out the headings, with extracts,
at some of which, remembering Aline&#8217;s presence, I frowned.
It was only a plain record of what happens in the crowded
cities of the older land&mdash;a murder, two suicides, and the
inevitable destitution and drunkenness, but he looked up
with kindling eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not shut my ears. The call was, &#8217;come an&#8217;
help us,&#8217; an&#8217; I&#8217;m going. Going back out of the sunshine into
the slums o&#8217; Lancashire.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, I reflected, was the man who had once attempted
my life&mdash;ignorant, intolerant, and filled with prejudice, but
at least faithful to the light within him; and I knew that
even if he failed signally, the aim he set before himself
was a great one. No suitable answer, however, suggested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
itself, and I was thankful when Aline said, &#8220;It is a very fine
thing to do. But what about your daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her place was by her husband,&#8221; said Lee; &#8220;but her
husband left her. Minnie is going back with me. Your
brother will take me to see her to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did so, at the risk of overtaxing the horses by a trying
journey through softening snow; but I sent a telegram to
Minnie, and when we left the cars she was there to meet
us, looking weak and ill, with shadows in the hollows
round her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very good of you to come, father,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I was an undutiful daughter, and I suffered for it. Now
I have broken the law, and the police troopers could take
me to prison. But I am tired of it all, father, and if you
will have me I am going home with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou&#8217;rt my own lass,&#8221; said Lee; and I found something
required my presence elsewhere, for Minnie was
shaken by emotion as she clung to him. And yet this
tearful woman had outwitted the tireless wardens of the
prairie, and, in spite of the law&#8217;s vigilance and deadly
cold, smuggled her faithless husband safe across the
border.</p>
<p>We stayed at Moran&#8217;s Hotel that night, and Mrs.
Moran acted with unusual good-nature, in the circumstances,
for she not only suffered Minnie to leave her at the
commencement of the busy season, but bestowed many
small presents upon her, and it was with difficulty that
I avoided giving her husband an order for sufficient implements
to till the whole of the Fairmead district.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;re here you had better make sure of a
bargain while you have a chance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Say, as
a matter of friendship I&#8217;ll put them in at five per cent.
under your best offer from Winnipeg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though I wished them both good fortune, satisfaction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
was largely mingled with my regret when the next day I
stood in the little station looking after the train which bore
Lee and his daughter back to his self-imposed task in
smoky Stoney Clough. Neither of them ever crossed my
path again; but still Harry and I discuss the old man&#8217;s
doings, and Aline says that there was a trace of the hero
hidden under his most unheroic exterior.</p>
<p>Not long after this Calvert called on us, and spent
two days at Fairmead before he went east again. He explained
his visit as follows: &#8220;The Day Spring will have
to get on as best it can without my services. The fact is,
I can&#8217;t stand its owner any longer. I was never very fond
of him&mdash;no one is, but I liked poor Ormond, and stayed
for his sake. So, informing the Colonel that he could henceforward
run the mine himself, I pulled out hoping to get a
railroad appointment in Winnipeg. By the way, there is
trouble brewing between him and your uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aline nodded toward me meaningly, and Calvert continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our tunnel leads out beside one boundary of the Day
Spring claim. I must explain that of late we found signs
that, in spite of a fault, the best of the reef stretched under
adjoining soil, and it was only owing to disagreements with
his men, and my refusal, that the Colonel neglected to jump
the record of a poor fellow who couldn&#8217;t put in the legal
improvements. He had intended to do so; while I believe
the miner, who fell sick, told your uncle. This will make
clear a good deal; you should remember it. Well, to work
our adit we had to make an ore and dirt dump on adjacent
land; and we&#8217;d hardly started it than two men began
felling timber right across our skidway, until, speaking as
if he commanded the universe, the Colonel ordered them
off. They didn&#8217;t go, however; and I really thought he
would have a fit when one of them said with a grin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
&#8216;Light out of this, and be quick. Don&#8217;t you know you&#8217;re
trespassing?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Carrington turned his back on them, and bade
us run out the trolley along the wooden way; and I did so,
against my judgment, for one of the men looked ugly, and
my master wasn&#8217;t exactly a favorite. The other fellow
was busy with the axe, and when he gave me a warning to
get out I proceeded to act upon it&mdash;which was fortunate,
for a big hemlock came down on the trolley, and all that
was left of it wasn&#8217;t worth picking up. Colonel Carrington
doesn&#8217;t usually give himself away, but he swore vividly, and
I went with him the next day into the timber city. It&#8217;s getting
a big place already. He stalked into the land agent&#8217;s
office with a patronizing air, and then said with his usual
frigidity:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who owns the timber lots about the Day Spring? I&#8217;m
going to buy them.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You can&#8217;t do it,&#8217; said the agent. &#8216;My client won&#8217;t
sell, and wants to give you warning that he doesn&#8217;t like
trespassing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That means he wants a big price,&#8217; said the Colonel,
looking at the map. &#8216;What&#8217;s his figure?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the agent grinned as he answered, &#8216;For the piece
you require for the ore-dump, ten thousand dollars.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is mad,&#8217; said the Colonel, &#8216;perfectly stark mad.
Tell him I shall dump my refuse on it, if I have to finance
somebody to locate a mineral claim. What is the name
of this lunatic?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Martin Lorimer,&#8217; said the agent. &#8216;The crown in that
case gives you the minerals; but before you put a pick into
the ground you must meet all demands for compensation&mdash;and
they&#8217;ll be mighty heavy ones. My client is also prepared
to collect them by the best legal assistance that money can
buy, and I guess you&#8217;ve given him a useful hint.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My respected chief just walked out; but I think he
was troubled at the name,&#8221; said Calvert. &#8220;And after that
there was some fresh difficulty every week, while his
temper, which was never a good one, got perfectly awful,
until I came away. He&#8217;ll go off in a fit of apoplexy or
paralytic seizure when his passion breaks loose some
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calvert furnished other particulars before he resumed
his eastward journey, leaving me with much to ponder.
An actively worked mine is a public benefit, and its owners
usually have free access and privilege upon the adjacent
soil; but I knew that in such matters as cutting timber,
water, and ore and refuse heaps a hostile neighbor could
harass them considerably. &#8220;Uncle Martin is going to
enjoy himself,&#8221; said Aline, when I told her so.</p>
<p>It was some weeks later when Harry and his assistants
came home, bringing with him a heavy bank draft and
a wallet stuffed with dollar bills. He looked more handsome
and winning than ever when he greeted Aline, and&mdash;though
it needed some experience of her ways to come
to this conclusion&mdash;I could tell that she regarded him with
approval. He had finished the railroad work, and when he
had furnished full details about it, he showed that he had
thoughtfully considered other matters, for he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, I guessed you would be busy altering Fairmead
on opportunity, and now that your sister has turned it into a
palace I should always be afraid of spoiling something; so I
have arranged by mail to camp with Hudson, of the next
preemption. His place is scarcely a mile away. Miss
Lorimer, you don&#8217;t realize the joys of living as a bachelor,
or you would freely forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I do,&#8221; said Aline. &#8220;Half-cooked food on plates
that have not been washed for weeks and weeks, and a
house like a pig-stye. Have I not seen my brother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
reveling in them? Mr. Harry Lorraine, from what
Ralph has told me, there is no one I should more gladly
welcome to Fairmead than its part-owner, and I am
surprised that he should prefer the pig-stye. Still, in reference
to the latter, is there not a warning about blindly
casting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; laughed Harry. &#8220;I crave mercy. In token
of submission I will help you to wash those dishes now.&#8221;
And, being perfectly satisfied to be for once relieved of the
duty, I lounged in the ox-hide chair watching them through
the blue tobacco smoke, and noting what a well-matched
couple they were. An hour had sufficed to make them
good friends; and I was quite aware that Harry had
entered into the arrangement merely for our own sake,
Hudson, as everybody knew, being neither an over-cleanly
nor companionable person.</p>
<p>When the last plate had been duly polished and placed
in the rack that Aline had insisted on my making, Harry
spread out a bundle of papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we will settle down to discuss the spring campaign,
if your sister will excuse us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aline is already longing to show me how to run
a farm. Go on, and beware how you lay any weak points
open to her criticism,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, there is the inevitable decision to
make between two courses,&#8221; said Harry; &#8220;the little-venture-little-win
method or the running of heavy risks
for a heavy prize. Personally I favor the latter, which
we have adopted before, and, which I think you have already
decided on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will take it as settled that we put every possible
acre under crop this spring, hiring assistance largely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
which, based on your own figures, should leave us this
balance. It&#8217;s a pity to work poor Ormond&#8217;s splendid beasts
at the plough, but of course you wouldn&#8217;t like to sell them,
and they must earn their keep. The next question is the
disposal of the balance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not sell them for any price,&#8221; I said. &#8220;My
idea is to invest all the balance&mdash;except enough to purchase
seed and feed us during winter if the crop fails&mdash;in cattle,
buying a new mower, and hiring again to cut hay. It&#8217;s
locked-up money, but the profit should provide a handsome
interest, and there&#8217;s talk of a new creamery at Carrington,
which promises a good market for milk. This brings us
back to the old familiar position. We shall be prosperous
men if all goes well, with just enough to pay our debts if it
doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I look for the former,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;But with your
permission we&#8217;ll deduct this much for a building fund&mdash;half
to be employed at the discretion of either. You will want to
further extend this dwelling, and I may buy Hudson&#8217;s place
under mortgage. It would be well-sunk money, for at the
worst we could get it back if we sold the property. You
agree? Then the whole affair is settled, and it only remains
for Miss Lorimer to wish us prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a very considerate partner, Mr. Lorraine, and if
I were a wheat-grower I should be proud to trust you. May
all and every success attend your efforts. Now put up those
papers, and tell me about British Columbia.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was very late when Harry walked back to Hudson&#8217;s,
while I did not sleep all night, thinking over the tremendous
difference that success or failure would make to myself and
Grace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>CONCERNING THE DAY SPRING MINE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a perfect day when we commenced the ploughing,
and we hailed it as a favorable augury that cloudless sunshine
flooded the steaming prairie. Glittering snow still
filled the hollows here and there, but already the flowers
lifted their buds above the whitened sod, and the air vibrated
to the beat of tired wings as the wild fowl returned like
heralds of summer on their northward journey. We had
three hired men to help us, in addition to the teams driven
by myself and Harry; but, and this was his own fancy, it
was Aline who commenced the work.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will remember our hopes and fears the day we
first put in the share. Many things have happened since,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but once more the harvest means a great deal to
both of us. Miss Lorimer&mdash;and we are now more
fortunate, Ralph, than we were then&mdash;you will imagine
yourself an ancient priestess, and bless the soil for us. That
always struck me as an appropriate custom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind had freshened the roses in Aline&#8217;s cheeks, and
her eyes sparkled as she patted the brawny oxen. Then
she grasped the plough-stilts, and, calling to the beasts,
Harry strode beside her, with his brown hand laid close
beside her white one. Theirs was the better furrow, for,
tramping behind my own team not far away, I could hardly
keep my eyes off the pair. Both had grown very dear to
me, and they were worth the watching&mdash;the handsome
strong man, and the eager bright-faced girl, whose merry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
laugh mingled with the soft sound of clods parting beneath
the share. They stopped at the end of the furrow, and I
wondered when Aline said with strange gentleness: &#8220;God
bless the good soil, and give the seed increase, that we may
use the same for Thy glory, the relief of those that are
needy, and our own comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen!&#8221; said Harry, bending his uncovered head, as, a
sinewy, graceful figure in dusty canvas, with the white sod
behind him, he helped her across a raw strip of steaming
clod, while neither of us spoke again until we had completed
another furrow. It was a glorious spring, and not
for long years had there been such a seed time, the
men who helped us said, while my hopes rose with
every fresh acre we drilled with the good grain. I was
sowing the best that was within me as well as the best
hard wheat, and it seemed that the rest of my life depended
on the result of it. There is no need to tell
how we labored among the black clods of the breaking, or
the dust that followed the harrows, under the cool of morning
or the mid-day sun, for we were young and strong,
fighting for our own hand, with a great reward before at
least one of us. Still, at times I remembered Lee, who was
in his own way fighting a harder battle against drunkenness
and misery, the reward of which was only hardship and
poverty. Once I said so to Aline, and she answered me:
&#8220;It was his vocation; he could not help it. Yours, and I
do not think you could help it either&mdash;you would have
made a remarkably poor preacher, Ralph&mdash;is to break new
wheat-lands out of the wilderness; for, you will remember&mdash;well,
I&#8217;m not a preacher either, but not wholly for Grace
or yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Women, I have since learned, not infrequently see,
perhaps by instinct, deeper into primal causes than men, and
there was more in her words than perhaps she realized, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
though the immediate impulse may be trifling or unworthy,
it is destiny that has set the task before us, and in spite of
the doer&#8217;s shortcomings it is for the good of many that all
thorough work stands. Many a reckless English scrapegrace
has driven the big breaker through new Canadian land
because he dare not await the result of his folly at home,
but nevertheless, if he ploughed well, has helped to fill the
hungry in the land he left behind.</p>
<p>It was during the sowing that Aline showed me a paragraph
in a Victoria paper which said, among its mining news:
&#8220;We hear that the Day Spring will probably close down
pending negotiations for sale. For some time there has been
friction with the owner of the neighboring property, who
has also located a mineral claim, and, it is said, has exacted
large sums for compensation. We understand there are indications
of fair payable ore, but further capital is needed
to get at it. We do not desire to emulate some newspapers
in sensational stories, but there is a tale of a hard
fight for this mine between two Englishmen, one of whom
championed the cause of an oppressed colonist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems cruel,&#8221; said Aline. &#8220;I am afraid Uncle
Martin is very revengeful, and I wish he had not done so
much. However, from what I hear, Colonel Carrington
almost deserves it, and he has evidently treated Uncle
Martin badly. I suppose you have not heard what caused
the quarrel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;and in all probability no one ever
will. It is, however, an old one, and they only renewed it
in Canada. Uncle Martin says little about his injuries, but
he doesn&#8217;t forget them.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was but the beginning, for we had news of
further developments shortly, when Calvert paid us a second
visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home to England for a holiday,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
&#8220;Secured a very indifferent post in Winnipeg, and was
delighted to hear of another mining opening in British
Columbia. Now, you&#8217;ll be surprised, too. It was to enter
your uncle&#8217;s service. I met him about the Day Spring sometimes,
and he apparently took rather a fancy to me, while
on my part I didn&#8217;t dislike him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Lorimer turned mine-owner! This is news,&#8221;
I said, and Calvert laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and of the Day Spring, too; I&#8217;m to manage it in his
interest. Now you see the method in his madness. It
appears that the Colonel had pretty well come to the end of
his tether&mdash;he is by no means as well off as he used to be&mdash;and
in his customary lordly way he told a financial agent
to get from any one whatever he could over a fixed limit. It
was, as a matter of necessity, a low limit. I warned Mr.
Lorimer that though there was a prospect of fair milling
ore we had found very little so far, but he&#8217;s a remarkably
keen old fellow, and had been talking to the miners,
especially the unfortunate one who had been holding out
against the Colonel&#8217;s attempts to squeeze him off his claim.
Mr. Lorimer agreed with him to let it lapse and re-record
it. So I went with him and his agent to sign the agreement,
and felt half-ashamed when Colonel Carrington came
in. Of course, I had no need to. He always treated me
with a contemptuous indifference that was galling, and a
man must earn his bread. Still, I had taken his pay,
and it hurt me to see him beaten down upon his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;He came near starting when he saw your uncle, but
made no sign of recognition, as, turning to his broker, he
asked in his usual haughty way, &#8216;Will you tell me what
this man&#8217;s business is?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Lorimer takes over the Day Spring,&#8217; said the
agent, and I fancy the ruler of Carrington swore softly
between his teeth, after which he said: &#8216;You told me it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
Smithson you were negotiating with. Is there any means
whatever by which I can annul the bargain?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Smithson bid beneath your limit, and then bought it
acting as broker for Mr. Lorimer,&#8217; was the answer. &#8216;I
have applied for a record of conveyance, and the sale was
made by your orders. It cannot be canceled now without
the consent of the purchaser, and a new record.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The two men looked at each other, your uncle
drawing down his thick eyebrows, which is a trick he has,
and the Colonel gnawed his lip. If it had happened in the
early gold days there would have been pistol shots. Then
my new employer said, &#8217;I will not sell,&#8217; and Colonel
Carrington flecked off a speck of dust with his gloves.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have bought it for less than a fourth of what I
spent on the property,&#8217; he said very coolly, &#8216;but if the
mine yields as it has done hitherto I cannot congratulate
you,&#8217; and he stalked out of the room. He was hard hit,
but he went down the stairway as unconcernedly as if he
had not come to the end of a fortune, while the new owner
said nothing as he looked after him. That&#8217;s about all,
except that the Colonel goes back to Carrington, and my
worthy employer to Mexico. He told me he had word
your cousin was not well there. I wonder, Ralph, how this
matter will affect you. Your relations with Miss Carrington
are of course not altogether a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not enlighten him. In fact, I hardly cared to ask
myself the question, for I could not see how the fact that
he had lost a considerable portion of his property could
increase the Colonel&#8217;s good-will toward me. Nevertheless,
if the difference in worldly possessions constituted one of
the main obstacles, as he had said it did, there had been a
partial leveling, and if we were favored with a bounteous
harvest there might be a further adjustment. I should not
have chosen the former method; indeed, I regretted it, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
it was not my fault that he had quarreled with Martin
Lorimer, who had beaten him in a mining deal. The
latter could be hard and vindictive, but there was after all
a depth of headstrong good-nature in him which was
signally wanting in the cold-blooded Colonel. I disliked
him bitterly, but now I almost pitied him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think there is any ore worth milling in the
Day Spring, Calvert?&#8221; I asked presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, I do. It will cost further money to bring it
up, but now that I have a free hand and unstinted material
I am even sanguine. We start in earnest in two months
or so, and then we will see&mdash;what we shall see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calvert left us the next day, and it was a long time before
I saw any more of him. The next news that I had
was that Grace and Miss Carrington had returned to Carrington.
I rode over to see them, and found a smaller number
of teams plowing than there should have been, while even
Miss Carrington, who received me without any token of
displeasure, seemed unusually grave, and several things confirmed
the impression that there was a shadow upon the
Manor. I could ask no questions, and it was Grace who
explained matters as I stood under the veranda holding
the bridle of Ormond&#8217;s hunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a strange world, Ralph,&#8221; she said in a tone of
sadness. &#8220;Rupert, as you will notice, knows me well, and
I never thought that one time you would ride him. Poor
Geoffrey! I cannot forget him. And now your uncle owns
the mine my father hoped so much from. The star of Fairmead
is in the ascendent and that of Carrington grows
dim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All that belongs to Fairmead lies at your feet,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;I value its prosperity only for your sake,&#8221; and she sighed
as she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but it is hard to see troubles gathering round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
one&#8217;s own people, though I am glad the mine has gone. It
was that and other such ventures that have clouded the
brightness there used to be in Carrington. Still, Ralph,&#8221;
and here she looked at me fixedly, &#8220;I am a daughter of the
house, and if I knew that you had played any part in the
events which have brought disaster upon it I should never
again speak to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could well believe her, for she had inherited a portion
of her father&#8217;s spirit, and I knew the ring in her voice, but
I placed one arm round her shoulder as I answered: &#8220;You
could hardly expect me to like him, but I have never done
him or any man a wilful injury, and until the sale was
completed I knew nothing about it. But now, sweetheart,
how much longer must we wait and wait? Before the
wheat is yellow Fairmead will be ready for its mistress,
and with a good harvest we need not fear the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must trust me still Ralph,&#8221; she said wearily. &#8220;I
am troubled, and often long for the wisdom to decide rightly
what I ought to do, but when I feel I can do so I will
come. Twice my father and I had words at Vancouver,
and sometimes I blame myself bitterly for what I said.
Wait still until the harvest; perhaps the difficulties may
vanish then. Meanwhile, because I am Grace Carrington,
and he would not receive you if he were here, you must
come no more to the Manor while my father is away. Besides,
each hour is precious in spring, and now you must
spend it well for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had perforce to agree. Grace was always far above the
petty duplicity which even some excellent women delight in,
and she added gently: &#8220;Some day you will be glad, Ralph,
that we acted in all things openly; but a fortnight to-morrow
I intend riding to Lone Hollow, from which I return
at noon. Then, as a reward of virtue, you may meet
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>It was with buoyant spirits that I rode homeward under
the starlight across the wide, dim plain, for the cool air
stirred my blood, and the great stillness seemed filled with
possibilities. The uncertainty had vanished, the time was
drawing in, and something whispered that before another
winter draped white the prairie Grace would redeem her
promise. Counted days as a rule pass slowly, but that
fortnight fled, for there was little opportunity to think of
anything but the work in hand in the hurry of the spring
campaign, and one night Raymond Lyle, of Lone Hollow,
and another of the Carrington colonists spent an hour with
us. Since Aline honored Fairmead with her presence we
had frequent visits from the younger among them. Aline
was generally piquant, and these visitors, who, even if a
few were rather feather-brained, were for the most part
honest young Englishmen, seemed to find much pleasure in
her company. Lyle, however, was a somewhat silent and
thoughtful man, for whom I had a great liking, and he had
come to discuss business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Lorimer, while I talk at length for once,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;A few of the older among us have been considering
things lately, and it doesn&#8217;t please us to recognize
that while nearly every outsider can make money, or at
least earn a living on the prairie, farming costs most of
us an uncertain sum yearly. We are by no means all millionaires,
and our idea is not to make this colony a pleasure
ground for the remittance-man. We have the brains, the
muscle, and some command of money; we were born of landowning
stock; and we don&#8217;t like to be beaten easily by the
raw mechanic, the laborer, or even the dismissed clerk.
Still, while these farm at a profit we farm at a loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I belong to the latter class,&#8221; I said; &#8220;and here are a
few reasons. We are plowing and grain-hauling while you
shoot prairie-chicken or follow the coyote hounds. We work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
late and early, eat supper in dusty garments, and then go
on again; while you take your hand at nap after a formal
dinner, and&mdash;excuse me&mdash;you look on farming as an
amusement, while the land demands the best that any
man can give it&mdash;brain and body. Besides, you are lacking
in what one might call commercial enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you,&#8221; said Lyle, &#8220;especially the latter.
Anyway, we have had almost sufficient of farming as a
luxury, and mean to make it pay. Colonel Carrington&#8217;s
ideal of an exclusive semi-feudal Utopia is very pretty, but
I fear it will have to go. Now I&#8217;m coming to the point.
You and Jasper have shown us the way to make something
out of buying young Western stock; but we&#8217;re going one
better. Breeding beef is only one item. What about the
dairy? We couldn&#8217;t well drink up all the milk, even if we
liked it; and we have definitely decided on a Carrington
creamery, with a Winnipeg agency for our cheese and
butter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Ralph, that should pay handsomely.
Only one rival in all this district! I see big
chances in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Raymond chuckled as he continued: &#8220;Specifications
have been got out for a wooden building, a location
chosen, and, in short, we want you two to cut the timber
and undertake the erection. We want a man we know,
Lorimer, whom we can discuss things with in a friendly
way. It can&#8217;t be ready this summer, and you can take
your own time doing it. The rest say they should prefer
you to an outsider; and your railroad building is a
sufficient guarantee.&#8221;</p>
<p>I lighted my pipe very deliberately, to gain time to
think. Neither Harry nor I was a mechanic; but in the
Western Dominion the man without money must turn his
hand to many trades, and we had learned a good deal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
railroad building. Neither need it interfere too much with
the farming, for we could hire assistants, even if we brought
them from Ontario; and here was another opening to
increase our revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Subject to approved terms, we&#8217;ll take it&mdash;eh, Harry?&mdash;on
the one condition that Colonel Carrington does not
specifically object to me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Where is the site?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Green Mountain,&#8221; answered Raymond Lyle. &#8220;As to
terms, look over the papers and send in an estimate. Payments,
two-thirds cash, interim and on completion, and the
balance in shares at your option. Several leading business
men in Brandon and Winnipeg have applied for stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Green Mountain!&#8221; broke in Harry. &#8220;That&#8217;s the Colonel&#8217;s
private property and pet preserve. Coyote, even timber
wolves, antelope and other deer haunt it, don&#8217;t they?
He will never give you permission to plant a creamery there.
Besides, I hardly fancy that any part of the scheme will
commend itself to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyle looked thoughtful. &#8220;I anticipate trouble with him,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Indeed, the trouble has commenced already.
But, with all due respect to Colonel Carrington, we intend
to have the creamery. He came home yesterday, and rides
over to see Willmot about it to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he had gone Harry laughed with evident enjoyment
of something.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fat will be in the fire with a vengeance now,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t give them credit for having so much sense.
It&#8217;s one thing to speculate and run gold mines that don&#8217;t
pay in British Columbia, but quite another to turn one&#8217;s
pet and most exclusive territory into &#8216;a condemned, dividend-earning,
low-caste, industrial settlement, by Gad, sir!&#8217;
Cut down the Green Mountain bluff, smoke out beast and
bird, plant a workman&#8217;s colony down in Carrington! Turn
the ideal Utopia into a common, ordinary creamery!&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
you will notice they mean to make it pay. The sun would
stand still sooner than the Colonel consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was inclined to agree with Harry, but I also felt that
if it were impossible to lessen Colonel Carrington&#8217;s opposition
to myself there was no use making further sacrifices
hopelessly. Even his own people had shown signs of revolt,
and Grace&#8217;s long patience appeared exhausted. There are
limits beyond which respectful obedience degenerates into
weakness, and the ruler of Carrington had reached them.</p>
<p>I met Grace at the time appointed, and her look of
concern increased when I mentioned the creamery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid it will lead to strife, and I am sorry that
you are connected with it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My father, though
I do not altogether agree with him, has a very strong objection
to the project, while even his best friends appear determined
upon it. It may even mean the breaking up of the
Carrington colony. Since the last check at Vancouver he has
been subject to fits of suppressed excitement, and my aunt
dare scarcely approach him. Ralph, from every side disaster
seems closing in upon us, and I almost fear to think what
the end will be. It is my one comfort to know that you
are near me and faithful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were hazy as she looked past me across the
prairie. Starry flowers spangled the sod, the grass was
flushed with emerald, while the tender green of a willow
copse formed a background for her lissom figure as she
leaned forward to stroke the neck of the big gray horse,
which pawed at the elastic turf. There was bright sunshine
above us, dimming even the sweep of azure, and a
glorious rush of breeze. All spoke of life and courage, and
I strove to cheer her, until a horseman swept into sight
across a rise, and my teeth closed together when I recognized
the ruler of Carrington. He rode at a gallop, and his
course would lead him well clear of where we stood, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
by drawing back a few yards the willows would have hidden
us. But I was in no mood to avoid him, even had Grace
been so inclined, which was not the case; and so we waited
until, turning, he came on at a breakneck pace. The
black horse was gray with dust and lather when he reined
him in, spattering the spume flakes upon me. After a stiff
salutation, I looked at the Colonel steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an obstinate and very ill-advised young man,
Lorimer of Fairmead,&#8221; he said, making an evident effort to
restrain his fury&mdash;at which I took courage, for it was his
cold malevolence that I disliked most. &#8220;Grace, you shall
hear now once and for all what I tell him. Lorimer, you
shall never marry Miss Carrington with my consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may not have been judicious, but I was seldom
successful in choosing words, and expected nothing but his
strongest opposition, so I answered stoutly, &#8220;I trust that you
will even yet grant it, sir. If not&mdash;and Miss Carrington
is of age&mdash;we must endeavor to do without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned from me, striking the impatient horse, and
when the beast stood fast, he fixed his eyes on his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you lost your reason as well as all sense of duty,
Grace?&#8221; he stormed. &#8220;What is this beggarly farmer, the
nephew of my bitterest enemy, that you should give up so
much for him? Have you counted the cost&mdash;hardship,
degrading drudgery, and your father&#8217;s displeasure? And
would you choose these instead of your natural position as
mistress of Carrington?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While I have strength to work for her she shall suffer
none of them,&#8221; I said. But neither, apparently, heeded me,
and, rapidly growing fiercer, the old man added:</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no half-measures&mdash;you must make the
choice. As that man&#8217;s wife you will never enter the doors
of the Manor. Remember who you are, girl, and shake off
this foolishness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>His mood changed in an instant. Colonel Carrington
was clearly not himself that day, for there was an almost
pleading tone in the concluding words, and he awaited her
answer in a state of tense anxiety, while I could see that
Grace was trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too late, father. The choice is already made,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;There are worse things than poverty, and if it comes
we can bear it together. We hope you will still yield your
consent, even though we wait long for it, and had you asked
anything but this I should have done it. Now I have
given my promise&mdash;and I do not wish to break it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was strained and uneven, and with a thrill of
pride, leaning sideways from the saddle, I caught her horse&#8217;s
bridle as by right of ownership. However, in spite of his
enmity, I was sorry for Colonel Carrington. It must have
been a trying moment, for he loved his daughter, but
wounded pride gained the mastery, and his face grew livid.
I made some protestation that we both regretted his displeasure,
and that Grace should want nothing which I could
give her, but again he utterly ignored me, and, wrenching
on the curb, backed the horse a few paces. Then, and I
shall never forget the bitterness of his tone, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;First those fools in British Columbia, then the men I
settled in Carrington, and now my child to turn against me
in my adversity. You have made your choice, girl, and you
will rue it. I will humble you all before I die.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught at his breath, his face twitched, and his left
hand sank to his side, but he wheeled the black horse with
his right and left us without another word, while Grace
sat looking after him with a white face and tears in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you what this has cost me, Ralph,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;No, you must not say anything just now. Give
me time to think; I can hardly bear it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>We did not resume our journey immediately, and when
we passed the next rise Colonel Carrington was far off on
the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will wait until harvest,&#8221; Grace said, in reply to
my questions. &#8220;There will, I fear, be changes by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later we rode into sight of Carrington, and
both instinctively drew rein; then Grace signified approval
as without speaking we rode on again. Still her faint smile
showed that she recognized my own feeling that we were
riding boldly into the camp of the enemy. Miss Carrington
met us at the entrance, and when I dismounted said to me
aside:</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother came in a little while since in an angry
mood. I fancy he must have met you, and will not ask
injudicious questions; but, to please me, you will go. He
has been broken in health lately, and any further excitement
is to be avoided just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took my leave accordingly, for as far as she could do
so without offending her brother Miss Carrington sympathized
with us, and as I rode back to Fairmead I could
not forget the Colonel&#8217;s curious manner when he concluded
the interview. I also recollected how Calvert had said:
&#8220;That man will end with a stroke, or in a fit, when he
lets his passion master him some day.&#8221;

<p>CHAPTER XXX</p>
<p>CARRINGTON ASSERTS HIS AUTHORITY</p>
<p>A week or two passed, and then when riding to Lone
Hollow on business connected with the creamery
scheme I chanced upon Jasper. I had seen very little of him
since Harry returned, and taxed him with it, saying:
&#8220;Have we frightened you away from Fairmead lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, with some confusion. &#8220;I guess
there&#8217;s no place in the Dominion where I should sooner go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, why don&#8217;t you come?&#8221; I asked; and the
big man hesitated still, inspecting his boots, until, facing
round toward me, he said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been figuring it mightn&#8217;t
be good for me. I&#8217;m a plain man with a liking for straight
talk, Ralph&mdash;so are you&mdash;and it might make things easier
if I were to tell you. It&#8217;s Miss Aline that scared me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I burst out laughing, but Jasper did not join; then I
waited somewhat astonished until he continued: &#8220;She&#8217;s
the flower of this prairie, and she&#8217;s got a mighty cute head
of her own. I never could stand them foolish women. So
I came, and I would have come every day, until Harry
chipped in, and that set me thinking. I said, &#8216;You stop
there and consider, Jasper, before it&#8217;s too late, and you&#8217;re
done for.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>I frowned at this, but Jasper added: &#8220;You don&#8217;t get
hold exactly&mdash;what I meant was this: I&#8217;m a big rough
farmer, knowing the ways of wheat and the prairie, and
knowing nothing else. She&#8217;s wise, and good, and pretty,
way up as high as the blue heaven above me. Even if she&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
take me&mdash;which, being wise, she wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;the deal
wouldn&#8217;t be fair to her. No; it couldn&#8217;t anyway be fair to
her. Then I saw Harry with his clever talk and pretty
ways, and I said, &#8216;That&#8217;s the kind of man that must mate
with her. Go home to your plowing, Jasper, before it becomes
harder, and you make a most interesting fool of
yourself.&#8217; So I went home, and I&#8217;m going to stop there,
Ralph Lorimer, until the right man comes along. Then&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ll wish Miss Aline the happiness I could never have
given her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a very good fellow, Jasper,&#8221; I said, and pitied
my old friend as he departed ruefully. He had acted generously,
and though I hardly fancy Aline would have accepted
him, in any case, I knew that she might have chosen
worse. There are qualities which count for more than the
graces of polish and education, especially in new lands, but
Harry possessed these equally, and, as Jasper had said, Aline
and he had much more in common. Then it also occurred
to me that there was some excuse for Colonel Carrington.
The cases were almost parallel, and to use my friend&#8217;s
simile Grace Carrington was also as high as the blue heavens
above her accepted lover. Still, if I had not the Ontario
man&#8217;s power of self-abnegation, and had forgotten what was
due to her, she had said with her own lips that she could be
happy with me, and I blessed her for it.</p>
<p>What transpired at Lone Hollow also provided food for
thought. Lyle and several of the supporters of the creamery
scheme awaited me there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have practically decided to accept your estimates,&#8221;
Lyle said, &#8220;but it seems advisable to make one or two alterations,
and we want you to ride over with us to Green
Mountain to-morrow and make a survey of a fresh site that
one of the others seems to think favorable. After we decide
on a place for the buildings, and a few other details, we&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
ask you to attend a meeting which we expect to hold at the
Manor. The matter will have to be discussed with Colonel
Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I should sooner you excuse me. I&#8217;m afraid that
my presence might prejudice the Colonel,&#8221; I replied, and
several of the others laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s prejudiced already,&#8221; said one. &#8220;Still, we are
growing rather tired of the Colonel&#8217;s opposition to whatever
he does not suggest himself, and we mean to build the
creamery. You will have to face your share of the unpleasantness
with the rest of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I almost regretted that I had furnished the estimates,
but it was too late and I could not very well draw back
now; so, promising to attend, I returned to Fairmead in
a thoughtful mood. Aline bantered me about my absent-mindedness,
and desired to learn the cause of it, but as Harry
was there and it partly concerned Jasper&#8217;s explanation I
did not enlighten her. Strange to say, I had never pictured
Harry as a suitor for my sister, but now I could see only
advantages in the union for both of them, and, what was
perhaps as much to the purpose, advantages for me. I expected
to bring Grace to Fairmead sooner or later, and
she and Aline were, I felt, too much alike in one or two
respects to agree.</p>
<p>On the following day I rode over to Green Mountain
with Lyle and three or four of his friends. We had a
measuring chain with us as well as one or two instruments
that I had learned how to use when railroad building, and
it was afternoon when we got to work plotting out the
alternative site for the creamery that one of the others had
considered more favorable on account of its convenience to
running water. The term Mountain is used somewhat
vaguely on the prairie, and Green Mountain could scarcely be
called a hill. It was a plateau of no great height dotted with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
a dense growth of birches and seamed by ravines out of one
of which a creek that would supply the creamery with power
came swirling.</p>
<p>We alighted on the birch bluff that stretched out some
distance into the prairie from the foot of the plateau, and
spent an hour or so before we decided that the new site was
more favorable than the other. Then Lyle turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better run our line through and mark it off
now that we&#8217;re here?&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>I agreed, and as one of the men had brought two or
three saws and axes in a wagon we set about it. The men
from Carrington, however, were not very proficient at the
work and a good deal of the chopping fell to me. The
bush was rather thick, and I spent an hour in tolerably arduous
labor before our base line was clear. Then I sat down
on a slender fallen birch while Lyle and the rest went back
to the wagon for some provisions they had brought. It was
evident that we could not get home for supper.</p>
<p>It was a still afternoon, and the sound of the creek rang
across the shadowy birches with an almost startling distinctness.
That end of the line had, however, nearly
reached the verge of the prairie. Presently another sound
that rapidly grew louder reached my ears. It was the rhythmic
beat of approaching hoofs, and for no very definite reason
it brought me a trace of uneasiness. However, I sat still
with my pipe in my hand until the drumming of hoofs that
grew very close stopped suddenly, and then turning sharply
I saw Colonel Carrington striding through the bush. He
stopped near my side, and nobody would have supposed from
his appearance that the sight of me or the fallen trees afforded
him any pleasure.</p>
<p>Three or four slender birches lay close at my feet, and
here and there another was stretched across the line I had
driven. Carrington&#8217;s face grew hard, and a little portentous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
sparkle crept into his eyes as he looked at them.
Then he turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Lorimer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will you be kind enough to explain
why you are cutting my timber without permission?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done it at Mr. Lyle&#8217;s request, sir,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Now I do not know how Carrington had heard of what
was going on, but his answer made it evident that he had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I had partly expected this. Will you tell Lyle that
I want him at once!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a request but a command flung at me with a
curt incisiveness that brought the blood to my face, and I
was never quite sure afterward why I went. Still, it was
usually difficult for even those who disliked him most to
disobey Colonel Carrington. In any case, I found Lyle and
the others, and came back with them outside the bluff which
was the easier way. Carrington, however, had evidently
grown impatient, and I saw Lyle&#8217;s lips set tight when he
and three or four of the younger men who I heard afterward
were rather indebted to the Colonel rode out from the shadow
of the bluff. One of my companions smiled expressively, but
nothing was said until Carrington drew bridle a few yards
away. He sat impassively still with one hand on his hip
and a handful of young lads behind him, and there was silence
for a few moments while the two parties looked at each
other. It was not exactly my quarrel, but I could feel the
tension.</p>
<p>Lyle stood close beside me quietly resolute, but one or
two of his comrades looked half-ashamed and as though
they wished themselves anywhere else, while the lads who
rode with Carrington were manifestly uneasy. Still, the
grim, erect figure sitting almost statuesque on the splendid
horse dominated the picture. At length Carrington indicated
me with a glance which, though I was ashamed of
the fact afterward, made me wince.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This man tells me that it is by your authority he is
cutting down my timber,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is quite correct in that, sir,&#8221; answered Lyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Carrington, and his voice was very sharp,
&#8220;you did not consider it necessary to ask my sanction?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyle looked at his companions, and it was evident that
they realized that the time for decisive action had come. The
Colonel clearly meant to assert his authority, and I fancied
that he would not hesitate to overstep it if this appeared advisable.
He had, however, ridden them on the curb too long,
and his followers&#8217; patience was almost at an end. Still, it
requires a good deal of courage suddenly to fling off a
yoke to which one has grown accustomed, and I sometimes
think that if Carrington had been a trifle less imperious
and Lyle had not stood fast then his companions once more
would have deferred to their ruler and the revolt would
never have been made. Perhaps Lyle recognized this for
his answer seemed intended to force the matter to an issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were afraid it would be withheld, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carrington understood him, for I saw the blood creep
into his face. &#8220;So you decided to dispense with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have preferred to put it another way, but it
amounts to that,&#8221; said Lyle, and there was a murmur of
concurrence from the rest which showed that their blood
was up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you may understand that it is refused once for
all,&#8221; said Carrington. &#8220;I will not have another birch felled
on Green Mountain. Now that you know my views there
is an end of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was wrong in this. The end which I think must have
proved very different from what he could have expected
had not yet come. He had taken the wrong way, for those
whom he addressed were like himself mettlesome Englishmen
of the ruling caste, and while they had long paid him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
due respect they were not to be trampled on. They stood
fast, and losing his temper he turned to them in a sudden
outbreak of fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go?&#8221; he thundered, and pointed to the
saws and axes. &#8220;Take those&mdash;things along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of them moved except Lyle who stepped forward a
pace or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a little more to be said, sir. You have refused
your sanction, but bearing in mind a clause or two in the
charter of the settlement I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s necessary.
In one sense Green Mountain is not exactly yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not mine!&#8221; and Carrington stared at him in incredulous
astonishment. Then he seemed to recover himself and
smiled in an unpleasant fashion. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have
been reading the charter, but there are several points that
evidently you have missed. For one thing, it vests practically
complete authority in me, and my decision as to any
changes or the disposal of any of the Carrington land can
only be questioned by a three-fourths majority of a general
assembly. I have not heard that you have submitted the
matter to such a meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not done so, sir,&#8221; answered Lyle.</p>
<p>There was, I thought, still a faint chance of a compromise,
but Carrington flung it away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I choose to exert my authority, and I
think that I have already told you to leave Green Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyle apparently recognized that the Colonel had the
best of it on what one might call a point of law, but the
way the latter used the word &#8220;told&#8221; would, I think, have
stirred most men to resistance. It was far more expressive
than if he had said commanded. Lyle stood quite still a
moment or two looking at the Colonel with wrinkled brows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you will listen to me for a few minutes, sir,&#8221; he said
at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; interrupted Carrington. &#8220;It would be a waste
of time. You know my views. There is nothing more to be
said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he committed the crowning act of folly as tightening
his grasp on his bridle he turned to the lads behind
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive them off!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The half-contemptuous command was almost insufferably
galling. Carrington might have been dealing with mutinous
dusky troopers instead of free Englishmen who farmed their
own land, and the lads who had at first appeared disposed
to side with him hesitated. He swung around in the saddle
and looked at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I speak twice?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>He turned again raising the heavy riding crop he carried,
and I expected to see the big horse driven straight at Lyle,
but one of the lads seized his leader&#8217;s bridle just in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, sir,&#8221; he cried, and then while the big horse
plunged he flung a few words at my companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, Raymond. Get out of this&mdash;now!&#8221;
he cried.</p>
<p>Lyle&#8217;s face was darkly flushed, and it appeared to cost him
an effort to hold himself in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Loose his bridle, Charley.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad did as he was bidden, and Lyle motioned us to
withdraw, after which he once more addressed Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have refused us permission to touch this timber,
and I suppose we must yield to your wishes in this respect,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s more than likely, too, that you
will object to our putting up the buildings we have in mind
anywhere about Carrington?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your surmises are perfectly correct,&#8221; replied the Colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lyle, &#8220;according to the charter we can overrule
your objections by a three-fourths majority, and I have
to give you notice that I&#8217;m going to call a meeting on
Thursday next to consider the matter. We have generally
met at the Manor to discuss anything of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carrington who appeared to have recovered his composure
raised his hand in sign of dismissal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time you wish in the evening&mdash;say six o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>We turned away and left him, but it seemed to me from
his manner that he would not have agreed to the meeting so
readily had he not been certain that it would cost him very
little trouble to humiliate the men who called it. Lyle appeared
very thoughtful as we rode away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry all this has happened, but it was bound to
come,&#8221; he said to one of his companions. &#8220;I may not have
been particularly tactful, but, after all, unless I&#8217;d given way
altogether I don&#8217;t see that I could have handled the matter
in any very different way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who rode beside him laughed somewhat ruefully.
&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;you simply can&#8217;t discuss a point with
the Colonel. I&#8217;m rather afraid the thing&#8217;s going to hurt a
good many of us, and it may result in breaking up the settlement,
but the fat&#8217;s in the fire now, and we must stand fast.&#8221;
He broke off for a moment with a sigh. &#8220;If he only
weren&#8217;t so sickeningly obstinate! It&#8217;s an abominably unpleasant
situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could understand how the speaker shrank from the task
in front of him. For years he and the others had rendered
their leader unquestioning obedience, and the Colonel
hitherto had ruled the settlement more or less in accordance
with their wishes, though I fancy that this was due to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
fact that their views had generally coincided and not to
any willingness to defer to them. It was, perhaps, not unnatural
that most of them should look coldly on innovations
and hold by traditions, for Englishmen are proverbially
averse to change. Still, they could recognize when a change
was absolutely necessary, and setting aside their predilections
and prejudices insist on it. I, however, had less of the
latter, since my status was not theirs, and it seemed to me
that the man who would be most hurt was Colonel Carrington.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that he had the gift of command.
Some men are unmistakably endued with it, and as a rule
everybody defers to them even when they do not use it
wisely. They come to regard it as their right, and by presuming
on the good-nature or supineness of those with whom
they come into contact, until at length the exception to the
rule appears. Then being boldly faced they prove to be
very much like other men. The air of authority disappears,
and everybody wonders why he allowed himself to be overawed
so long.</p>
<p>Still, I sympathized with Lyle who rode slackly, as it
were, gazing straight in front of him with thoughtful eyes.
There was no doubt that what he meant to do was repugnant
to him, especially as the Colonel was a distant kinsman
of his. He was a quiet, honest, good-humored Englishman,
but men of that kind now and then prove very
grim adversaries when they are pushed too hard, and they
stand for what they consider the interest of their fellows.
Nothing further was said until we reached the spot where the
trail to Fairmead branched off, and then Lyle turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll expect you at the Manor on Thursday,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then they rode on to Carrington, and I turned off toward
Fairmead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE DEPOSED RULER</h3>
</div>

<p>The day of the meeting was never forgotten at Carrington,
and distorted rumors of what had happened there
traveled far across the prairie. One Mennonite settler
compared it to the downfall of King Herod, but among
Carrington&#8217;s own people there were none who referred to
the events of that evening without reluctance and regret.</p>
<p>It was a glorious afternoon when I set out, and the prairie
was fresh and green after a gentle rain that promised an
early sprouting of the seed, but as I neared the Manor the
faces of those I met were anxious and somber. They looked
like men who after mature consideration had undertaken an
unpleasant duty, and I could not help a fancy that some of
them wished themselves well out of it. Saddled horses,
buggies, and wagons stood in front of the house, and further
mounted figures were approaching across the prairie,
but the men who had already arrived seemed more inclined
to wait for them than to enter the building, until its owner
stood in the doorway. He looked at them with a little grim
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the first time you have been here, and this
difference appears a little unusual,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>I went in with the others, and was not pleased when
Lyle placed me beside himself in a prominent position. Indeed,
after a desultory conversation during which no one
seemed quite at ease it was a relief to hear the last arrivals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
dismount and then to take our places at the long table upon
which Lyle had deposited plans of the settlement. He with a
few others of what was evidently the executive committee
sat near me, and the rest stretched back toward the doorway.
As we waited a few moments in a state of tense expectation
the details of the scene impressed themselves on my memory.</p>
<p>There were heads and skins, as well as Eastern weapons&mdash;trophies
the Colonel had brought home from several of
England&#8217;s smaller wars&mdash;on the cedar wainscot. The prairie
was flooded with sunlight outside, and an invigorating
breeze that flowed in through the open windows brought with
it the smell of the grass and stirred the heavy curtains. Carrington
sat at the head of the table in a great oak chair
which Grace once told me had come from a house that was
famous in English history. There was an escutcheon which
some of the settlers derided on the paneling above it, and
the sunlight beating in through a window fell on him. He
sat very erect, a lean, commanding figure with expressionless
face and drooping white moustache, close to the great English
pattern hearth which in winter assisted the much more useful
stove, while both his manner and the surroundings suggested
some scene in the feudal ages rather than an incident
on the newly-opened prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You asked me to meet you, and, as far as I can see,
every man in Carrington is here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Raymond
Lyle, you called this meeting. We are waiting for what
you have to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyle was not an orator, but he was filled with his subject,
and the men listened to him that day. First he supplied
them with details respecting the projected creamery, and
then straightening himself a little he turned his quiet,
honest eyes upon his host.</p>
<p>&#8220;We desire to have your approval, sir, but we clearly
recognize the necessity for more attention to the commercial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
side of the question if there is to be a lasting future for
Carrington,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are proud of the colony, and
we are all sportsmen, I think, but it seems to us that it is
not wise to make it a mere playground and keep out all but
people of our own station. On the contrary it would be
better to welcome any well-educated Englishman and make
it easier for him to earn a living here. In fact, we want an
open-door policy, and a means of providing for the future of
our children. It can be provided only by industrial enterprise,
which is why I advocate the building of the creamery.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time a cynical smile flickered across Carrington&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you speaking for yourself, or for the rest?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;For myself certainly,&#8221; said Lyle. &#8220;How far the rest
agree with me will be seen if we appeal to them as an
assembly with power to decide, which, unless we are forced
to it, I think most of us should sooner avoid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; remarked Carrington dryly, &#8220;in your case, at
least, I quite fail to see any duty toward posterity. You
have always lived among us as a bachelor, Lyle. I suspect
your other arguments would appear equally foolish on
examination. Will somebody else set out the precise advantages
we may expect to derive from this creamery. I
wish to see how far the crazy notion has laid hold of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyle flushed. Some of the younger men laughed, and it is
possible that had their leader shown any sign of faltering,
the Colonel&#8217;s sarcastic disapproval would even then have
induced them to abandon the scheme. Most of the men of
Carrington had, however, made up their minds, and several
in succession explained in deferent but determined fashion
why they considered it necessary to support Lyle. Carrington,
I fancied, found it somewhat difficult to hide his astonishment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are going down to the root of the matter,&#8221; said the
last of them. &#8220;We wish to earn money, and not merely to
spend it on half-hearted farming; and every desirable settler
who takes up Carrington land increases the value of
our possessions, and what is more important, our means of
progress. We want more bridges, graded roads through the
coul√©es, a stockyard on the railroad, and some day a branch
line; and with all deference to you, we mean to get them.
If this is impossible under present conditions, those conditions
must be changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a murmur of approval, but watching Colonel
Carrington I knew that the man had said too much. In
reply to a sharp question as to who was to undertake the
building operations my name was mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lorimer of Fairmead! I might have known it!&#8221;
gasped the Colonel.</p>
<p>Then there was silence as he gazed down the long rows of
faces before answering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have listened with painful surprise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
wish to hear my views, and you shall have them, but first I
want to read the agreement made by each one of you when
you first settled in Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did so, and some of the men looked uncomfortable,
for the land-settlement scheme practically made him supreme
authority over all matters which the law of Canada did not
affect. It also made it clear that he had borne the largest
share of the cost of inaugurating the colony. He broke off,
and it was a few moments before he went on again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I founded this colony, and&mdash;I feel compelled to mention
it&mdash;delivered some of you from difficulties, and brought
you here. I have spent my time and money freely for the
good of the Carrington district, and I have made it what
it is, a place where an English gentleman can live economically
if he will work a little, enjoying abundant sport and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
the society of his equals. That was my one object, and I
have accomplished it, but further I will not go. Green
Mountain is the finest cover for game on the prairie, and
while I live no man shall cut timber, make roads, or put
up a factory there. Neither will I in any way countenance
the opening up of Carrington&mdash;my Carrington&mdash;to industrial
exploitation for the influx of all and sundry. I will
have no railroad nor any kind of factory within our limits
if I can prevent it, and seeing in it the thin end of the
wedge I must ask you to abandon the creamery scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly, and then turned to Lyle again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you lost your senses, Raymond. Would you make
this clean, green land like Lancashire or parts of Pennsylvania?&#8221;</p>
<p>One could see by the faces of the others that this shot had
told. There was no great liking for commerce in any of
those who heard him. They were sportsmen first of all,
and they loved the open. Even had the thing been probable
none of them would have wished to see Carrington defiled
by the smoke of mills and factories. It seemed to me
that the Colonel might have bent them to his will had he
made some trifling concession or been willing to discuss the
matter quietly. Most of them, I felt, would gladly have
met him half-way. Still that was never a habit of Colonel
Carrington&#8217;s. He was an autocrat all through, and when
he desired anything done he simply commanded it. In a
moment or two Lyle answered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At least, not exactly, though Lancashire
clothes half the people in the world with her cotton,
and the roads that have opened up this continent are laid
with Pennsylvania steel. Still, as we haven&#8217;t iron or coal
here there&#8217;s very little probability of our doing what you
seem afraid of with Carrington. We believe that the enterprise
will prove a general benefit. We merely want good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
wagon roads, a creamery, and a few other similar things,
and we respectfully ask you not to veto them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t meet you,&#8221; said Carrington. &#8220;As I said, my
suggestion is that this preposterous scheme be abandoned
forthwith.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was for a few moments a silence which seemed intensified
by the soft rustle of the curtains as the breeze from
the prairie flowed into the room. Then one of the men who
had spoken in favor of the creamery rose and looked hard
at Lyle who made a little sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then as a matter of form and to take a vote I second
that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The others were very still, but I saw Carrington gaze at
the speaker almost incredulously. Though, as one of them
told me afterward, a vote had once before been asked for,
it had only established their leader&#8217;s authority more firmly,
and I think this was the first time that any determined opposition
had been offered to his will.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to take a vote?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; said another man, and there was a little murmur
of concurrence. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there is no other course
left open to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the Colonel stared at them incredulously, and it
seemed to me that there was something almost pathetic about
the old man&#8217;s position. Grim and overbearing as he was,
he stood alone, and for the first time I think he to some
extent realized it. Still, it was evident that he could not
bring himself to believe that they would go so far as to
overrule his plainly expressed decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you must proceed to take it. As
stipulated in the charter it must be by ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man who had not spoken yet, stood up. &#8220;To save time
I move as an amendment that a committee be appointed to
confer with Mr. Lorimer, who is here for the purpose, as to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
the construction of the creamery and to prepare a workable
scheme which will if possible be submitted to this meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was seconded, and Lyle moved down the long table
with a handful of little papers. It was clear that the supporters
of the scheme had everything ready, and for the
first time a shadow of doubt seemed to creep into Carrington&#8217;s
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all supplied?&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;Then we
will, as usual, take the amendment first.&#8221;</p>
<p>One or two of them borrowed a pencil from a neighbor,
but it seemed very significant to me that most had one
ready, and though I had no part in what was being done,
I felt the tension when a man moved down the table collecting
the little folded papers on a tray. Then the Colonel
signed for him and another man to open them, and I think
every eye was fixed on the two men who stood by the window
tossing the papers upon a growing pile. There was
only one pile, though three little slips were laid suggestively
by themselves. Then in the midst of a very impressive silence
through which the footsteps broke with a startling
distinctness the two men moved toward the head of the
table. The rest leaned forward watching their ruler who
sat very still and grim in face. I fancied that though he
was anxious he could not realize what awaited him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have all voted?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; said one of the men in a voice that sounded
somewhat strained, and Carrington looked at him sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;The result?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amendment is carried, sir. There are only three
dissentients.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one spoke, but I think a thrill ran through everybody
in the room, and I know the blood rose to my face. Still,
I fancy their own sensations troubled very few of my companions
for every eye was fixed on their leader, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
stiffness seemed suddenly to melt out of him. He gasped,
and for a moment or two seemed to be struggling to
recover himself.</p>
<p>Though I had not expected this I felt sorry for him. All
but three of his followers had turned against him, and it was
evident after what had been said that their decision implied
the subversion of his authority. To a man of his temperament
it must have been inexpressibly galling. Then he
painfully straightened himself. He had in all probability
never been beaten yet, and he had once, so his sister afterward
told me, tamed a native levy of irregular cavalry and
commanded them for two years in spite of the fact that a
number of the dusky troopers had sworn to murder him on
opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot have the Green Mountain site, and I&#8217;ll stop
this thing yet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The listeners&#8217; faces were a study. Indignation, regret,
suppressed sympathy and a determination to maintain their
rights, were stamped on them.</p>
<p>They were Englishman born with a due respect for constituted
authority who had loyally obeyed a leader of their
own class, but they had also the average Englishman&#8217;s
respect for the liberty of the individual, and there were signs
of approval when Lyle spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have every respect for you, Colonel Carrington, and
the course we have been compelled to take is a painful one,
but I think there was no avoiding it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In regard
to the charter, we have kept it faithfully even when you
rather overstrained its meaning. Now we can no longer
allow it to bar all progress, and we have resolved, if in
agreement with one clause it can as I think be done, to
entirely remodel it by a unanimous assembly. If not we
will sell our holdings and move out in a body onto Government
land.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></p>
<p>Lyle had faced the crisis. There was nothing left but
open defiance, and he did not shrink from it. When he
broke off, Carrington, who had listened with the veins
swelling on his forehead, rose suddenly. It was evident
that he had allowed his passion to master him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you all turn against me, you dividend-hunting
traitors?&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;You whom I brought here,
and spent the best of my life for, squandering my daughter&#8217;s
patrimony on this colony until she too sets her will against
me. Then listen to me. You shall do none of the things
you say. By heaven, you shall not. There shall never be a
factory in my settlement. In spite of you&mdash;I say&mdash;you
shall not&mdash;do&mdash;one&mdash;of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice broke, and his jaw dropped. The hand he had
swung up fell to his side, and I heard a faint cry as he
sank limply into his chair. He lay there with his head on
the carved back gazing at his rebellious followers with
glassy eyes.</p>
<p>I do not know who was the first to move, but in a
moment I was standing near his side, and while a confused
bustle commenced behind us I saw Lyle slip an arm beneath
his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring water, somebody! Ask Miss Carrington for
brandy&mdash;don&#8217;t tell her what it&#8217;s for,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hurry,
he&#8217;s either in a fit or choking.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man brought the spirits, and Lyle mopped Carrington&#8217;s
forehead with a wetted handkerchief, which was probably
of no great benefit, while when with the assistance of
somebody I managed to open his clenched teeth and pour a
little brandy down his throat a faint sign of returning sense
crept into his eyes. He looked at us in a puzzled manner,
saying in short gasps, &#8220;Lorimer and Lyle! You shall not&mdash;I
tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe this was the last time he ever recognized us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
When his face grew expressionless, Lyle who laid him back
again, turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice that he moved as though he had no
power in his left side?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Foster and Broomfield,
come here and help me. Armadale, you go and tell
Miss Carrington tactfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>We left consternation behind us when after the return of
the unwilling Armadale we carried the Colonel into his
great bedroom where he lay breathing stertorously while
Foster remained to assist his sister. Then the murmurs
broke out as I returned, and each man looked at his neighbor
in dismay, until there was once more stillness when dressed
in some clinging white fabric Grace stood with a stern, cold
face in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have spoken sufficient for one day,&#8221; she said, and
some of those who heard her afterward observed how like
her voice was to her father&#8217;s. &#8220;Enough to kill my father
between you. May I ask you, now that you can do no
more, to leave this house in quietness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The climax had filled them with consternation. They had
acted in all honesty, and I cannot think they were to blame,
but the riders of Carrington, stalwart, courageous men,
slunk out like beaten dogs under the gaze of the girl. When
they had gone, she beckoned me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride hard to the railroad, and don&#8217;t return without a
doctor from Winnipeg. I wish to hear no excuses or
explanations. Every moment is precious&mdash;go!&#8221;</p>
<p>I went, much as did the others, and found Lyle who
looked very shamefaced fumbling with his saddle cinch
outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an unfortunate business, but of course we never
expected such a sending&mdash;heaven forbid!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well,
if the wires will do it we&#8217;ll bring out the best doctor
they&#8217;ve got in Winnipeg. With all respect to them I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
shouldn&#8217;t like to be Foster left behind to face those two
women. Go home, and abuse me for making an unprecedented
mess of it if you like, the rest of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a hard ride to the railroad, for we did not spare
the beasts, and when the instrument clicked out a message
that the doctor was ready but could not start before the next
day&#8217;s train Lyle wired back, &#8220;Come now in a special. We
guarantee expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned to me. &#8220;I think we were justified in
what we said; but he was our chief, and a good one for a
long time. Now I&#8217;d give up the whole scheme to set the
thing straight again.&#8221;</p>
<p>In due time we brought a skillful surgeon to Carrington
Manor, and waited very anxiously until he descended in
search of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is by no means a common case,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mental
aberration and partial paralysis. Miss Carrington refers me
to you for the possible cause of it. I gather that Colonel
Carrington was a headstrong man who could brook no
opposition to his will and was subjected to great excitement
at a meeting you held.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Lyle. &#8220;Without going into unnecessary
details, he strenuously resisted a project we had decided on,
and the defeat of his wishes apparently came as a shock. He
was speaking vehemently and collapsed in the middle of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What one might have anticipated,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;I
scarcely think the result will be fatal, but Colonel Carrington
will never be the same man again. It is quite likely
that he will not recover the use of his mental faculties,
though it is rather premature to speak definitely yet, and I
should not unduly alarm the two ladies.&#8221; Then, perhaps
noticing the genuine distress in Lyle&#8217;s face, he added, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think you need attribute too much to the incident you
mentioned. It was only the last straw, so to speak, for I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
fancy the patient had been under a severe mental strain for
a long time, and from what his sister tells me he was
predisposed to attack, while some other cause would probably
have precipitated the crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sent word asking whether Grace would see me, and receiving
an answer that she would see no one I rode moodily
back to Fairmead. As Lyle had said, we were sorry, and
should have given much to undo what had been done, but
it was too late, and I felt that Colonel Carrington who
could never have accepted a public defeat had, unyielding to
the last, made a characteristic ending.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>THE NEW RULER OF CARRINGTON</h3>
</div>

<p>A month slipped by, and though I rode over often to
the Manor it was seldom that I had speech with Grace,
and never saw her father. The attack had left him with
intellect clouded and limbs nearly powerless on one side,
while he would hardly permit either his sister or daughter,
who were the only persons he apparently recognized, to
leave his sight. It was also with some trepidation that I
awaited the first interview with Grace, but this vanished
when she came in showing signs of an anxious vigil but
only pleasure at my presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry that I spoke so to you, Ralph, that awful
day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For hours together I have thought over all
that happened, and though it was hard to overcome a feeling
of resentment against the others, and even you at first, I
tried to judge them fairly; and, if it is not disloyal to say so,
I think they were right. Some day, when there will be
many things to settle, I hope to tell them so; but I cannot
do it yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would say nothing in the meantime as to her own
plans, beyond that before she could consider herself there
was much to be arranged that concerned her father and the
Manor, and with this I had to be content. Lyle also
showed his regret in a practical fashion by visiting the
Manor constantly and supervising the farming, though I
knew his own holding suffered in consequence, and by his
advice young Foster had been appointed bailiff at a salary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
Meanwhile, Harry and I were busy almost night and day,
for when the sowing was finished I brought out carpenters
and set them to work extending Fairmead, while with our
own hands we hewed wind-felled timber where we could
find it in the bluffs ready for them and the creamery. It
was often necessary to ride long leagues for birches stout
enough, and we frequently slept on the bare earth or in the
wagon beside our work.</p>
<p>To please a friend in Winnipeg I had accepted the
services of a destitute British mechanic, who, when he arrived
at Fairmead, with his fare advanced at our expense,
demanded the highest wages paid in Canada, and then expressed
grave doubts as to whether he could conscientiously
undertake the more laborious parts of the framing, because
he was a cabinet joiner, and this, so he said, was carpenter&#8217;s
work. We had met others of the kind before, who had
made their employers&#8217; lives a burden in the old country, but
they were the exception, after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can please yourself,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;m a landowner
and ploughman; but if I hadn&#8217;t my hands full
already I&#8217;d tackle anything, from making bricks to framing
bridges, for the wages you&#8217;re getting. However, to please
you, we&#8217;ll call the operation joinery.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had further trouble with this individual, who continually
lamented he had ever come to a country wherein
there was no beer, and derided his Ontario comrade for
doing too much. The longer a job lasted the better for
those employed on it and the rest of the profession, he said:
to which, as we heard later, the Ontario man replied: &#8220;If
the job lasts too long in this country they pretty well fire
you out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last, returning one morning wet with dew from a
damp bed on a bluff, where we had slept after toiling late
the night before, we decided to dispense with his services.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, man! if you get on at that rate it will
take you two years to finish,&#8221; I said, when I found him
tranquilly notching the ends of some beams with mallet and
chisel. &#8220;How long do you spend over one? And didn&#8217;t I
tell you to use the axe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Half a day to make a good job! There&#8217;s no man in
Canada can teach me what tools to use,&#8221; he said; and,
being stiff all over, I turned to Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a fair edge on that axe. You might show him,&#8221;
I suggested.</p>
<p>Harry, who was in a hurry, flung off his jacket, badly
tearing it; and for a while the heavy blade made flashes
in the sunlight, while the white chips leaped up in showers,
until, flinging down the axe, he pulled out his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten minutes exactly&mdash;you can dress it another five,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Now are you willing to do it in that way?
No? I didn&#8217;t suppose you would be. Well, we won&#8217;t
detain you. Give him his fare to Winnipeg and some
breakfast, Ralph&mdash;it will pay you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found Ormond&#8217;s horses useful; for between timber-cutting,
marking down growing hay, rides to purchase
cattle, and visits to the Manor, we often covered fifty miles
a day, with hard work besides; while, when we brought out
Ontario bushmen, Fairmead and the creamery lumber piles
increased rapidly in size, and our bank balance diminished
as rapidly. Once, too, when I came home so weary that I
could scarcely get out of the saddle, I found a black-edged
letter awaiting me, and dropped heavily into a chair after
opening it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope there&#8217;s no bad news,&#8221; said Aline; &#8220;it has an
American stamp. Who can it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Alice! You might read it&mdash;the sun and the
grass dust have almost blinded me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Lorimer had written the letter from a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
town in Southern California, and Aline read: &#8220;I am in sore
distress, Ralph. Your poor cousin died here yesterday of
an old sickness she had long greatly suffered from. She was
my only child&mdash;all that was left me; and I&#8217;m going back
to England a very lonely man. I&#8217;ll ask you in a post or
two to meet me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, and yet it may have been a release,&#8221;
said Aline. &#8220;Hers was a very hard lot to bear, but she
was always cheerful. Poor Uncle Martin! Of course
you will go to meet him.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did so later when, as a special favor, a mounted man
brought me a telegram from Elktail, and Martin Lorimer
gripped my fingers hard when I boarded the east-bound
train at that station.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew thee would come, Ralph, and I was longing for
a face that I knew,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ay, to the last my poor girl
remembered thee. I&#8217;m going home to England&mdash;stayed
here too long; and Canada seems empty without her. Only
time to catch the liner, or I&#8217;d have come to Fairmead, and
I&#8217;ve much to tell thee on the road to Winnipeg.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked sadly shaken, but glad to meet any kinsman
in his trouble, and, asking few questions, I listened quietly
while, ensconced in a corner of a first-class car, he relieved his
soul with talk. He told me much that surprised me, but
which is not connected with this story, until I started when
he said: &#8220;Now I may tell thee that it was Alice sent that
money. She did it main cleverly,&mdash;her own savings, poor
girl; I&#8217;m glad I never stinted her in the matter of money.
&#8216;You can tell him when I&#8217;m gone, father; it pleased me
well to know I had helped to make him happy,&#8217; she said.
Then again, almost at the end, she whispered: &#8216;Tell Ralph
I wish him a long life, and the best this world can give him
and Miss Carrington.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Lorimer coughed vigorously before he continued:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
&#8220;I never heard a word about that loan until I
guessed from thy tale at the chalet that my girl, never suspecting
it, had countered my plans. Well, well, it was all
as it had to be; but if she had never helped thee maybe
another Lorimer would be waiting instead of a stranger to
carry on the Orb Mill when I&#8217;ve done with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were nearing the Red River, and the roofs of
Winnipeg lifted themselves higher above the prairie, when
he said, for Martin Lorimer, almost timidly, &#8220;Remembering
our talk at the chalet, canst change thy mind, lad, or is it
too late?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too late, Uncle Martin,&#8221; I answered with reluctance,
for I longed to do something to comfort him.
&#8220;As I told you, even if I were ready there are others to
consider now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sighed before he answered sadly: &#8220;Ay, thou&#8217;lt take
thy own road; it&#8217;s born in thee. Then follow it steadfastly,
and God bless thee. Some day I&#8217;ll come back to Fairmead,
but I must have time to get over this blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later we parted, and it was some hours
after the Atlantic express pulled out of Winnipeg before I
recovered my serenity. I could not forget the kindness of
my dead cousin, who, in spite of sickness and physical
suffering, had so cleverly aided me in my time of need.</p>
<p>The next event of moment happened when Foster brought
me a message from Grace requesting my presence at the
Manor on the following day. Most of the men of Carrington
were also expected, Foster said. I reached the
Manor at the appointed time, and made the latter portion
of the journey in company with several of the colonists,
and it was with mingled curiosity and reluctance that we
gathered in the great hall.</p>
<p>Except that the air was warmer and there were flowers
and feathery grasses in the tall vases, it looked much the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
as it did on our last eventful visit, though there was now no
grim figure in the carved oak chair. No one knew why we
had been summoned except Lyle and myself, and I did not
know wholly. So there was a buzz of curious whispers,
until Lyle flung back the doors, and Grace, followed by
Miss Carrington, appeared in the opening. They were
dressed alike in some neutral-tinted fabric, and with one
accord the riders of Carrington rose to their feet, and stood
fast and motionless until with a queenly gesture Grace seated
herself in the oaken chair. Grace was younger than myself
by two full years, but there was no trace of diffidence about
her as she looked down out of steady eyes at the men
who, as it were, did homage before her. Then deep silence
followed as she said with a perfect distinctness:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fitting after what has happened that I should
send for you. My father founded this colony, and still
nominally holds the greater portion of the land in it. As
you know, he has been stricken&mdash;and has lost his reason;
and accordingly the management of the estate devolves
upon Miss Carrington and myself&mdash;principally, under his
last will, on myself. It is a heavy responsibility for two
women, to do the best, not only for Carrington Manor,
but for the Carrington colony, until it shall please the
Almighty to restore its founder&mdash;or grant him release.
While the Manor lands remain intact and the agreement
binding, all that affects our welfare affects that of the whole
settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace paused, and a man rose upright at the further
end of the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came here with a feeling of contrition, yet not
wholly ashamed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On behalf of all I offer the
new mistress of Carrington our deepest sympathy and an
assurance of good-will,&#8221; and again there was a deep murmur
of chivalrous respect from the sun and wind-bronzed men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>Grace&#8217;s gaze was not so steady and her voice was lower
as she answered, &#8220;I thank you. It is a barren heritage,
weighted down by debt, but with the help of my kinsman
Lyle we shall do our utmost to improve it. Still, it was
not that that I wanted to tell you. How we last parted you
know,&#8221; and some of those I noticed showed a darker
color in their cheeks, as though it were an unpleasant
memory. &#8220;Since then I have tried to consider rightly all
that led up to it, and I ask you to forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was our own blind precipitancy. I am afraid you
spoke the truth,&#8221; a voice said; but raising her hand for
silence Grace went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said, this estate entails a heavy responsibility, and I
have been considering what I should do concerning the
creamery. My father acted as seemed right according to
his judgment, and I do not know all his reasons, but now
that the decision devolves upon me I am impelled to act
according to my own. No two people see the same thing
under the same aspect, and&mdash;this is no disrespect to him&mdash;I
dare not do otherwise. I think the creamery will enhance
the settlement&#8217;s prosperity, and though I cannot grant the
Green Mountain site, in which you must bear with me, you
may take the next best, the Willow Grove, with its timber
and water, at an appraised value, to be represented by
stock in the creamery. This is all I have to tell you, and
until I resign this position to Miss Carrington I trust to enjoy
your friendship and good-will. You will, I hope, decide,
before you go when to start the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still a ruler of Carrington; we haven&#8217;t a
Salic law. We are all your servants, madam,&#8221; a big man
said, and when some one cried, &#8220;To the Princess of
Carrington,&#8221; the rafters rang to the thunderous cheer,
while once more I wondered that Grace should ever have
listened to me. Whether it was born in her, an hereditary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
dowry, or was the result of her father&#8217;s influence and
company, I do not know, but Grace, who could at other
times be only womanly, spoke to the riders of Carrington
with the air of a sovereign. And yet it appeared perfectly
seemly that she should do so, for whether mirthful, commanding,
or pitiful, Grace was in all things natural.
Neither is this prejudice in her favor on my part, for it is
well known on the Assiniboian prairie. Still, even after
work had commenced on the creamery and the finances
of the Manor were adjusted temporarily, Grace would give
me no definite promise as to when she would leave it for
Fairmead. As yet her first duty was toward the helpless
old man and the charge he had left her, she said.</p>
<p>By one of the striking coincidences that it is hard to
believe are accidents, it happened that as we mounted outside
the Manor a buggy came around one corner of the
house, and with a feeling akin to consternation we turned
to regard its occupant. A hired man held the reins, but
beside him, wrapped in a fur coat although the day was
warm, sat Colonel Carrington, a shivering, huddled object
propped against the backboard. It was the first time we
had seen him, and the sight troubled us, for the few weeks
had made great changes in the ruler of Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m breaking orders,&#8221; the driver explained.
&#8220;Miss Grace said wait until you all had gone, but he would
come, and I hadn&#8217;t the heart to refuse him. He&#8217;s not
understanding much these days, but we take him out for
an hour or two, when he&#8217;s able for it, in the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Carrington regarded us as if we were strangers,
as with a pitiful courtesy some raised their hats to him.
He attempted with one hand to strike a match and
dropped it, and after Lyle ignited another and held it to
his cigar he nodded cordially. &#8220;I thank you, sir,&#8221; he said
with an entire absence of recognition. &#8220;I am not quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
as strong as I used to be. Could you tell me how far it is
to Lone Hollow? I seem to have forgotten the way, and
the snow is soft and heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a relief to all of us when the buggy drove off,
and the assembly broke up with a sudden chill upon its
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>One evening later I was walking home past Hudson&#8217;s
dwelling when I noticed a curious cloud of dust hanging
over the house, and strange sounds proceeding from it.
They suggested that somebody was vigorously brushing it,
which was certainly unusual. Now Hudson, though he
held a quarter-section of Government land, had really no
legal claim to it, because he had neither broken sufficient
virgin sod nor put the necessary acreage under cultivation.
He freely admitted that he was prejudiced against hard
work, and, when in need of a few dollars to purchase actual
necessities that he could not borrow, he would drive away
with his wagon and peddle German oleographs and patent
medicines to the less-educated settlers, returning after several
weeks&#8217; absence to settle down again to a period of loafing.</p>
<p>Aline and her friend Lilian Kenyon, as well as the
latter&#8217;s brother were with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth can they be doing inside there, and what
a noise they are making,&#8221; said Miss Kenyon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows that my good counsel has not all fallen on
stony soil,&#8221; Aline answered laughingly. &#8220;Harry&mdash;that is
Mr. Lorraine&mdash;is apparently seriously engaged in spring
cleaning. I have been giving him lessons lately on the
virtues of cleanliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Understanding the process, I grinned at this, and fancied,
though I could not be certain, that Aline&#8217;s fair companion
envied her the opportunity for giving Harry lessons on anything.
When the next cloud of dust rolled out of the
window an irate voice came with it:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the biggest slouch on the prairie, eh; I&#8217;ll pretty well
show you nobody takes liberties with me. I&#8217;m almighty
sick of this fooling already; there goes your confounded
bucket, and the rest of the blamed caboodle after it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilian Kenyon started when a bucket fell clattering at
her feet, a brush came hurtling toward us, and amid wild
language a grimy figure appeared at the window, dropping
chairs and other furniture wholesale out of it, while her
brother, who strove to conceal his merriment, observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, hadn&#8217;t you two better come on with me? It&#8217;s
getting late already, and Hudson is not as particular as he
ought to be when he&#8217;s angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you,&#8221; said Aline in a tone of severity.
&#8220;He is a very disgraceful man, and by no means a fit
companion for Harry. Ralph, I am sorry there are occasions
when both of you indulge in unwarranted expressions.
Don&#8217;t you think such conduct unbecoming in an elder
brother, or any respectable landowner, Lily?&#8221;</p>
<p>I laughed and Miss Kenyon looked indignant when I
answered: &#8220;Then go along; you don&#8217;t understand our
trials, or you wouldn&#8217;t condemn us. It can only be natural
depravity that leads Harry to persist in living with such a
companion when half the girls on the prairie are willing to
provide him with a better one.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had hardly left me when, disheveled and dusty,
Hudson strode forth in wrathful disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almighty hard when a man can&#8217;t live peacefully in
his own home without your confounded partner brushing all
over it,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s your sister&#8217;s doing&mdash;I
knew there would be trouble when she came in, stepping
like a gopher on wet ploughing, with her skirts held up.
Anyway, I&#8217;m blamed well sick of Canada, and them Government
land fellows are coming right down on me, so I&#8217;m
just going to drop the whole thing and skip. I&#8217;m going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
to sell the place for an old song, or burn it, and light
out for Dakota.&#8221;</p>
<p>I frowned, for this was the first time I had heard of
Aline&#8217;s visit, and it struck me that although I suffered from
her craze for neatness at Fairmead she was overstepping
the bounds in attempting to reform Hudson&#8217;s homestead
too; but Harry evidently overheard him, for he came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to talk sensible for once, Hudson,&#8221; he said. &#8220;See
here, I don&#8217;t want to take advantage of your beastly
temper, but if you are really bent on selling the place, and
not vaporing as usual, I&#8217;m open to make you an offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been willing to sell it for two years,&#8221; Hudson
answered with a grin. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t done half my legal breaking,
and don&#8217;t mean to, so it&#8217;s not mine to sell, and would
have to remain registered to me until the improvements
were completed. Then, you see, I could come back, and
jump you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;You might
hurt yourself trying it. How much do you call a fair thing
for the holding as it stands, bearing in mind our risk in
buying what is only the good-will with the owner absent?&#8221;</p>
<p>They haggled over the terms for a while, and then
Harry turned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do it at a stretch, Ralph, by paying him so
much after the crop&#8217;s sold for the next two years. Of
course, it&#8217;s a big handful, but there&#8217;s lots of sloo hay that
would feed winter stock, and I want the house badly. Indeed,
if I don&#8217;t get it I&#8217;m going to build one. Don&#8217;t you
think we could take the risk?&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought hard for a few minutes. We were speculating
boldly, and already had undertaken rather more than we
could manage; but the offer was tempting, and, noting
Harry&#8217;s eagerness, I agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; we will chance it,&#8221; I said, &#8220;on his own terms of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
yearly payments, although heaven only knows how we&#8217;re
going to finance it if the crop dies off. Hudson, I&#8217;ll give
you a small check to-morrow if you are satisfied, but it&#8217;s
fair to tell you that if you stayed and completed the improvements
you would get more for it when you held the
patent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Hudson. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll take the
check. You may have the building and the hundred
and sixty blanked acres, scarcely ten of them broken. It&#8217;s
easier peddling pictures than farming, any day, and no
one else would buy it in the circumstances. It&#8217;s not
even mine without the patent, and if I die in the meantime
you&#8217;ll get nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get the crop and the cattle feed; you don&#8217;t
suppose we&#8217;ve bought it to look at; and if you died the
pay would stop,&#8221; said Harry dryly, and turned toward me
when Hudson, moving away contented, sat down to enjoy a
peaceful smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles it, Ralph,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The deal ought to
show a good result, and I wanted the house. Now that I
have got it, it&#8217;s time for me to ask you a question which
would have to be answered presently in any case. I was
waiting to see how things would go, out of fairness to her,
but as we have bound ourselves hard and fast to Fairmead
for several years at least, I&#8217;m going to ask you a great thing.
Will you give me Aline?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will she have you?&#8221; I said smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Harry answered rather
dismally. &#8220;Sometimes I hope so, and sometimes I&#8217;ve a
cold fear that she won&#8217;t. But now that I&#8217;ve told you, I&#8217;ll
ask her this very evening. You&#8217;ll wish me Godspeed, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at him with sympathy, for I knew the feeling,
and I had some experience of Aline&#8217;s moods. Then I laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
my hand on his shoulder, &#8220;We have been as brothers for a
long time, Harry, and it would be only good news if you
strengthen the tie. If Aline has the wisdom I give her
credit for, she won&#8217;t say no, and there&#8217;s no one in the
Dominion I should sooner trust her to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll make the plunge,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Ralph, I&#8217;m
very grateful for your good-will. Hudson, where did you
fling that confounded bucket? Get up and straighten
yourself, and go after Miss Kenyon. Take her anywhere
away from Miss Lorimer, and, if you feel like it, make love
to her. You&#8217;re not bad-looking when you wash yourself,
and I think she has a fancy for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; said Hudson grinning as he refilled his
pipe. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had one experience in that line, and I don&#8217;t
want another. No, sir, henceforward I leave women alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harry went back to the house to shed his working attire,
and I strode on toward Fairmead, leaving Hudson sitting
among his furniture and kitchen utensils on the darkening
prairie, smoking tranquilly. The stars shone out when
Harry and Aline came in together. Harry looked exultant,
Aline unusually subdued, and me first thing she did was,
to my astonishment, to kiss me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aline has promised to marry me before the winter,&#8221;
said Harry.</p>
<p>Wishing them every happiness I went out and left them.
I was occupied two hours over some badly needed repairs
to the granary, and then for a long time I stood under the
stars thinking of Grace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>A BOUNTIFUL HARVEST</h3>
</div>

<p>Henceforward Harry&#8217;s wooing, like my own, was
conducted in an intermittent and fragmentary manner.
But little time was left us for dalliance or soft speeches, and
we paid our homage in practical fashion, with axe and saw
and bridle, for there was truth in what Harry said: &#8220;The
best compliment a man can pay a woman is to work for her
comfort. Still, I don&#8217;t know that more leisure for other
things wouldn&#8217;t be pleasant, too. There is more in life
after all than an endless round of sowing and reaping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasper was among the first to congratulate him, which
he did so heartily that I concluded that he had stopped his
visits in time, and it was with a repetition of his former
kindness that he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need to rustle this season, for you&#8217;ve plainly
bitten off more than you can chew. Still, you&#8217;ve friends
on the prairie who&#8217;ll see you through, and if it&#8217;s horses or
men or money you&#8217;re stuck for, I guess you know where
to find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>We borrowed oxen, we borrowed mowers, we hired help
everywhere, and somehow paid for it, while by dint of endless
planning we managed to avoid an overdraft at the bank.
Still, I lamed Ormond&#8217;s hunter, and dawn was often in the
sky when I rode home from the Manor to begin the day&#8217;s
round again without resting. But our efforts prospered, and
the weather favored us, while Jasper and other neighbors,
including some from Carrington, helped us on opportunity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
until one summer day I rode over to the Manor to press for
a decision. I hesitated when I got there, for I was heavy
from want of sleep and troubled about many small matters,
and, when Grace greeted me, she looked so fresh and
tranquil that it seemed unfair to bring the stains of turmoil
and fierce hurry into her presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are tired, poor Ralph,&#8221; she said, laying a cool hand
on my forehead when I drew her down beside me. &#8220;The
sun has darkened you to the color of a Blackfoot. You
are thin, and there are too many wrinkles on your brow&mdash;put
them away immediately. I wonder whether any one
would recognize in you the fresh-faced and somewhat callow
stripling with whom I talked about the Dominion that day
on Starcross Moor. It is not so very long ago, and yet life
has greatly changed and taught us much since then. You
must not be vain about it, but I really think I prefer you
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She strove to avoid my answer, which was an active one,
and then settled to grave attention when I said: &#8220;You were
always the same, Grace, unequaled among women. I was
very raw and foolish, but you have helped me, and experience
in these new lands teaches even fools. Now, however,
I am chiefly lonely&mdash;and Fairmead is waiting for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to know my duty,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;I still think
and think until my brain grows tired, and yet I cannot see
it clearly. As I told the others, the Manor is an undesirable
inheritance; but I am its mistress, and it brings heavy
charges with it, a load of debt among them, which it would
seem cruel to leave my aunt to grapple with. If we sold it
there would be nothing left for her, and even that might
not be possible while my father lives. Ralph, dear, he was
once very kind to me, and it is hard that I can do so little
to help him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span></p>
<p>She sighed, and looking at me wearily made no answer
to my further pleading, until, as it happened, Miss Carrington,
preceded by a very awkward Scandinavian maid,
entered the room with a tray on which was placed the
Russian tea and dainties for which the house was famous.</p>
<p>&#8220;You looked in need of refreshment, Ralph, when you
came in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There have been changes at the Manor,
but we have not forsaken all our ancient customs.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was, as Aline said, &#8220;a dear old lady,&#8221; sweet of face,
yet stately, though now she looked careworn too; and rising
I bowed respectfully, as, acting under one of those
sudden impulses which are sometimes better than judgment,
I said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will believe that no one regrets the changes
more than I do, and it is only trusting in your kindness
that I venture to look for a welcome here. There cannot
be many who would so kindly receive one who even
against his will has been indirectly connected with your
troubles. Besides, I have been abusing your generosity further
by trying to persuade Grace to desert you, and, strangest
of all, I ask you to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace blushed, and her aunt sat silent for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you told me,&#8221; she then answered quietly,
&#8220;for I have been thinking what she ought to do. I wondered
now and then that my niece did not ask me, and I
am going to tell my thoughts to both of you. There is a
will extant leaving her this property, with a portion to me,
but it will be a long struggle to free the land from its
creditors, and my poor brother may live as he is for years.
He has been mercifully spared all further anxiety, and I
hope that he will. I am old, and my day has long gone
by. Grace is young, with the world before her; and it is
neither right nor necessary that she should put away all
hope of happiness indefinitely. There is only one time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
when the joy of life is more real than its sorrows. With
kinsman Lyle&#8217;s counsel, and Foster to work the land, I can
hold the Manor and care for my brother, and for both to
remain here would be a useless sacrifice. So if you love
her, as I believe you do, it is right that you should enjoy
together what is sent you. Grace should go to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had passed my younger days among a homely people,
and had been taught little except what I learned in the
silence of the mountains and on the wide prairie, and yet I
think it was without awkwardness that I bent over Miss
Carrington&#8217;s hand. Speech would hardly have expressed
the gratitude and respect I felt, while I recognize now that
the motive of the action was in her and not in me. Then
I turned to her niece and waited with longing in my eyes
until Grace, who had changed to her softest mood and was
now only a blushing girl, said simply:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have made it easy, Aunt. Ralph, I will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; said Miss Carrington. &#8220;Ralph, you
have waited patiently, and I can trust you to be kind to
her.&#8221; Then she smiled upon us as she added: &#8220;If not, I
take my brother&#8217;s place, and you shall answer for it. There
is still a Carrington at the Manor holding authority. And
so, to turn to the practical, if either of you can consider
such prosaic things as tea, it is growing cold already, and
it is a pity to waste the Carrington tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tea was not wasted. We are only creatures of flesh
and blood, thankful, the wiser among us, for the transitory
glimmer of romance that brightens our work-a-day lot, and
gives some much-needed strength to grapple with it, and
I had ridden far after a night spent in the open and
a hard morning&#8217;s work. So I accepted what was offered,
and found it delicious to rest in that pretty room, where
the last of the sunlight sparkled on the silver and lit up
the sweet face of the lady who beamed upon us. Again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
it seemed almost too good to be true, and hard to believe,
that victory had crowned the struggle, while even as I balanced
the dainty China cup it reminded me of the battered
kettle from which we filled the blackened cans in a British
Columbian camp. There, instead of embroidered curtains,
were festoons of cedar sprays, biting cold and acrid wood-smoke
in place of warmth and artistic luxury, and I knew
that I had been favored greatly&mdash;for though many strive,
the victory is to the few. Still, from out of the shadows of
the somber firs, I seemed to hear our partner who lay among
the boulders say: &#8220;The long, long road has a turning,
and there is rest at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before I left the Manor late that night all was settled,
for when I pressed for an early conclusion Grace, yielding,
said: &#8220;I am not afraid of poverty, Ralph; and if it comes
we will lighten it by each bearing half. So we will take
the risk of the harvest together, for if I share in your
prosperity I must also take my share in the hardship.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not get home to Fairmead until the next day, for
I nodded in the saddle until I could not see the way, and
several times nearly fell out of it, and when the tired horse
stopped on a bluff I found a couch in withered fern and
slept there soundly, to waken long after sunrise, wet with
dew. That, however, was a trifling matter on the Western
prairie, because the man who loves small comforts has no
business there, and after the events of the previous day discomfort
was nothing to me. Dreams seldom trouble the
toiler in that land; and when I stood up refreshed under
the early sunlight, and memory returned, the world seemed
filled with light and beauty to reflect my own gladness.
Ormond&#8217;s horse was cropping the grasses not far away, and
when I caught him the very birch leaves rustled joyfully
under their tender shimmering green as we rode over the
bluff, while once out on the prairie a flight of sand-hill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
cranes came up from the south, calling to one another,
dazzling blurs of whiteness against the blue, and even their
hoarse cry seemed to ring with triumph.</p>
<p>Aline ran out to meet me when I dismounted, and my
mood must have been infectious, for she smiled as she greeted
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent Harry to scour the prairie in search of you, for
I feared you must have been dead tired and the horse had
fallen in a ravine. But you must have slept among the
fairies, Ralph, and risen transfigured. You look too radiant
for my serious brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was after hay-time, and the wheat was tall and green,
when Grace and I were married in the little wooden church
at Carrington, and every man in the settlement rode there
in her train. Few princesses of royal blood ever had a finer
escort than hers, and she came in state, as was due to her&mdash;for
Grace was a prairie princess and the heiress of Carrington.
Perhaps the memory of what had happened made
her subjects doubly anxious to show their loyalty; while,
remembering who I was, and how I landed in that country
a poor emigrant, once more I found it hard to understand
why of all men such a gift had been bestowed on me.</p>
<p>The riders of Carrington also filled one room at the
Manor with glittering tokens of their good-will from
Toronto and Montreal, besides such useful things as tools
and harness, while among the presents lay a plain letter with
a black border which Grace and I read together. It was
from Martin Lorimer. &#8220;I wish you both many blessings,&#8221;
it ran, &#8220;and knowing your foolish way of thinking, I could
not send the present I wanted to; but you&#8217;ll take this, with
an old man&#8217;s very good wishes. It&#8217;s a certificate of paid-up
stock in the new Day Spring Mining Company, of which
Calvert is manager. Sell or hold as pleases you. You&#8217;ll
find a market&mdash;for already Calvert&#8217;s sending up good ore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
I also send you something else&mdash;your cousin valued it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another paper fluttered out of the envelope, and my
amusement died away as I recognized the letter I had given
the bankers in Winnipeg when I drew upon the loan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the gifts I value this from poor Alice most,&#8221; I
said a little huskily. &#8220;We should have gone under without
it, and perhaps it alone helped me to win you. Grace, to
both of us, this is the strangest of wedding presents; but
what shall we do with these shares in the Day Spring mine?
They represent the principal portion of the paid-up capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will keep them,&#8221; Grace said. &#8220;I think I understand
why he sent them. I had a very bitter feeling against
your uncle, but I have conquered it. The past is never
done with, and it may be that what my father toiled for and
lost will come to his daughter in its own way. Ralph,
there&#8217;s a story of hope and struggle and sorrow written
between every line on either paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>We rode, in accordance with prairie custom, straight
home from the church, for Grace was no longer princess of
Carrington, but the wife of a struggling farmer, and she said
that until the harvest was gathered there must be no honeymoon.
Fairmead, as all the inhabitants of the prairie know,
was only a small holding hampered by lack of capital when
she married its owner and forthwith commenced to live in
strict accordance with her adopted station. We hoped to
improve that station, but this depended on the crops and the
weather, and the heavens continued to favor us that year.
Seldom had there been such grass for cattle or such a yield
of wheat. No acre returned less than its twenty bushels,
and many nearer forty; while Grace, who drove the first
binder into the tall yellow stems and worked on through
the rush and dust of harvest and thrashing, rejoiced as she
said she had never done when all was safely gathered in.</p>
<p>Then Harry and Aline were married and settled in Hudson&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
dwelling; and one evening toward the close of the
Indian summer, when our work was done at last we drove
slowly down the long incline away from Fairmead. A
maple flamed red on the bluff, the birch leaves were golden;
but the prairie was lone and empty, save for a breadth of
tall stubble, and there was neither a sack in the granary
nor a beast in a stall. Harry had taken the working cattle,
while the stock were traveling eastward across the ocean
and the wheat lay piled in the elevators or had been ground
already into finest flour. But the result of our labors was
bearing interest, and would do so until spring, in the shape
of a balance at the Bank of Montreal. Each venture had
succeeded, and evidence was not wanting that at last we
were being carried smoothly forward on the flood-tide of
prosperity; and so with thankful hearts we prepared to
enjoy a well-earned holiday in the older cities of eastern
Canada.</p>
<p>The garish light died out as we passed the last of the
stubble, which grew dusky behind us, the stars that shone
forth one by one glimmered frostily, and silence closed down
on the prairie, while the jingle of harness and the groaning
of wheels recalled the day I had first driven across it.
Grace, too, seemed lost in reverie, for presently she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Another year&#8217;s work ended, and the bounteous harvest
in. Ralph, why is it that happiness brings with it a tinge
of melancholy, and that out of our present brightness we
look back to the shadows of other days? I have been
thinking all day of curious things and people we knew&mdash;our
first dance at Lone Hollow, of Geoffrey Ormond and your
cousin. They all played their part in giving us what we
now enjoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I cracked the whip, stirring the horses into a quicker
pace, and, slipping one arm around her, I said: &#8220;It is not
those who work or suffer most who are always rewarded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
as they would hope to be; and, as Johnston once said, the
fallen have done great things. But we will look forward.
You made true forecasts that night at Lone Hollow, and no
fairer witch ever came out of Lancashire. So look again
deep into the future, and tell me what you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace laughed, and nestled closer to me under the furs,
for the nights were chilly, before she answered: &#8220;There
are compensations, and one cannot have everything, so I lost
the gift of prophecy when a better one came to me&mdash;and,
Ralph, it came that very night at the Hollow, I think.
Instead, I will tell you what I hope to see. First, you
faithful to your task, as faithful to me, laying together acre
on acre and adding crop to crop until the possessions of
Fairmead are greater than Carrington. But even before
this comes&mdash;and come, I think, it will&mdash;we will try to
remember that we are but stewards, and that possession
brings its duties. My father was a keen sportsman, and I,
too, love a horse and gun, but we thought too much of
pleasure at Carrington. We will fling our doors wide open
to the English poor&mdash;there are no poor in the Dominion
like the English poor&mdash;and share with the needy the harvests
that are granted us. I have been thinking often of
your helper, Lee, and as a beginning he could send you two
families in the spring&mdash;we have room for them. And so,
Ralph, if you will humor me in this I shall never be sorry
to preside over Fairmead instead of Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; I answered simply; but she seemed content
with the answer, and asked for no further assurance as we
drove on through the night. No one could laugh more
joyously than Grace, or cast about her flashes of brighter
humor; but we had just completed an arduous task whose reward
was greater almost than we dared hope, and our
gladness was too great to find expression in merriment.</p>
<p>On reaching the Elktail station I was handed a telegram
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
from Calvert which had lain there some time awaiting
an opportunity for delivery. It was brief, but reassuring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great news. Bottomed on rich ore at last. Day
Spring stock cent. per cent. premium. Don&#8217;t sell. Looking
for surprising dividends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the beginning,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;Some day all
the rest will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, with a blast of the whistle and the lighted
cars clashing as they lurched up out of the prairie, the Atlantic
express rolled in and bore us east to enjoy our belated
honeymoon.</p>
<p>Grace&#8217;s prediction was fulfilled, for although we had
reverses we prospered from that day, and there are now
few farms anywhere on the wide grass-lands between Winnipeg
and Regina, to compare, either in area or fertility,
with Fairmead, while the flour made from our wheat is
spread across the breadth of Europe. And better than lands
and stock is the content and peace that came to me through
Grace&#8217;s companionship.</p>
